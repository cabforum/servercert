# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

This document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary (but not sufficient) for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates; Certificates that are trusted by virtue of the fact that their corresponding Root Certificate is distributed in widely-available application software. The requirements are not mandatory for Certification Authorities unless and until they become adopted and enforced by relying-party Application Software Suppliers.

**Notice to Readers**

The CP for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet in order to issue Publicly Trusted TLS Server Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a CA should include in its CPS. Except where explicitly stated otherwise, these Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after 1 July 2012 (the original effective date of these requirements).

These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates. In accordance with RFC 3647 and to facilitate a comparison of other certificate policies and CPSs (e.g. for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the RFC 3647 framework. However, rather than beginning with a "no stipulation" comment in all empty sections, the CA/Browser Forum is leaving such sections initially blank until a decision of "no stipulation" is made. The CA/Browser Forum may update these Requirements from time to time, in order to address both existing and emerging threats to online security. In particular, it is expected that a future version will contain more formal and comprehensive audit requirements for delegated functions.

These Requirements only address Certificates intended to be used for authenticating servers accessible through the Internet. Similar requirements for code signing, S/MIME, time-stamping, VoIP, IM, Web services, etc. may be covered in future versions.

These Requirements do not address the issuance, or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier.

These Requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root Certification Authority through successive Subordinate Certification Authorities.

## 1.2 Document name and identification

This certificate policy (CP) contains the requirements for the issuance and management of publicly-trusted TLS Server certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs to assert compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.2) as follows:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) baseline-requirements(2) domain-validated(1)} (2.23.140.1.2.1);` and

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) baseline-requirements(2) organization-validated(2)} (2.23.140.1.2.2);` and

## 1.3 PKI Participants

The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary organization of Certification Authorities and suppliers of Internet browser and other relying-party software applications.

### 1.3.1 Certification Authorities

Certification Authority (CA) is defined in [Section 1.6](#16-definitions-and-acronyms). Current CA Members of the CA/Browser Forum are listed here: <https://cabforum.org/members>.

### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities

With the exception of [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control) and [Section 3.2.2.5](#3225-authentication-for-an-ip-address), the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

1. Meet the qualification requirements of [Section 5.3.1](#531-qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements), when applicable to the delegated function;
2. Retain documentation in accordance with [Section 5.5.2](#552-retention-period-for-archive);
3. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
4. Comply with
   a. the CA's Certificate Policy/Certification Practice Statement or
   b. the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

The CA MAY designate an Enterprise RA to verify certificate requests from the Enterprise RA's own organization.
The CA SHALL NOT accept certificate requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. The CA SHALL confirm that the requested Fully-Qualified Domain Name(s) are within the Enterprise
RA's verified Domain Namespace.
2. If the certificate request includes a Subject name of a type other than a Fully-Qualified Domain Name, the CA SHALL confirm that the name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are affiliated (see [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation)) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested Subject FQDN falls within the Domain Namespace of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA.

### 1.3.3 Subscribers

As defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions).

In some situations, a CA acts as an Applicant or Subscriber, for instance, when it generates and protects a Private Key, requests a Certificate, demonstrates control of a Domain, or obtains a Certificate for its own use.

### 1.3.4 Relying Parties

"Relying Party" and "Application Software Supplier" are defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions). Current Members of the CA/Browser Forum who are Application Software Suppliers are listed here:  
<https://cabforum.org/members>.

### 1.3.5 Other Participants

Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the AICPA/CICA WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force and ETSI ESI. Participation by such groups does not imply their endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.

## 1.4 Certificate Usage

### 1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses

The primary goal of these Requirements is to enable efficient and secure electronic communication, while addressing user concerns about the trustworthiness of Certificates. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses

No stipulation.

## 1.5 Policy administration

The Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates present criteria established by the CA/Browser Forum for use by Certification Authorities when issuing, maintaining, and revoking publicly-trusted TLS Server Certificates. This document may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum. Because one of the primary beneficiaries of this document is the end user, the Forum openly invites anyone to make recommendations and suggestions by email to the CA/Browser Forum at <questions@cabforum.org>. The Forum members value all input, regardless of source, and will seriously consider all such input.

### 1.5.1 Organization Administering the Document

No stipulation.

### 1.5.2 Contact Person

Contact information for the CA/Browser Forum is available here: <https://cabforum.org/leadership/>. In this section of a CA's CPS, the CA shall provide a link to a web page or an email address for contacting the person or persons responsible for operation of the CA.

### 1.5.3 Person Determining CPS suitability for the policy

No stipulation.

### 1.5.4 CPS approval procedures

No stipulation.

**Applicant**: The natural person or Legal Entity that applies for (or seeks renewal of) a Certificate. Once the Certificate is issued, the Applicant is referred to as the Subscriber. For Certificates issued to devices, the Applicant is the entity that controls or operates the device named in the Certificate, even if the device is sending the actual certificate request.

**Applicant Representative**: A natural person or human sponsor who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant:

  i. who signs and submits, or approves a certificate request on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
  ii. who signs and submits a Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
  iii. who acknowledges the Terms of Use on behalf of the Applicant when the Applicant is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.

**Attestation Letter**: A letter attesting that Subject Information is correct written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party customarily relied upon for such information.

**Audit Period**: In a period-of-time audit, the period between the first day (start) and the last day of operations (end) covered by the auditors in their engagement. (This is not the same as the period of time when the auditors are on-site at the CA.) The coverage rules and maximum length of audit periods are defined in [Section 8.1](#81-frequency-or-circumstances-of-assessment).

**Audit Report**: A report from a Qualified Auditor stating the Qualified Auditor's opinion on whether an entity's processes and controls comply with the mandatory provisions of these Requirements.

**Authorization Domain Name**: The FQDN used to obtain authorization for a given FQDN to be included in a Certificate. The CA may use the FQDN returned from a DNS CNAME lookup as the FQDN for the purposes of domain validation. If a Wildcard Domain Name is to be included in a Certificate, then the CA MUST remove "`*.`" from the left-most portion of the Wildcard Domain Name to yield the corresponding FQDN. The CA may prune zero or more Domain Labels of the FQDN from left to right until encountering a Base Domain Name and may use any one of the values that were yielded by pruning (including the Base Domain Name itself) for the purpose of domain validation.

**Authorized Ports**: One of the following ports: 80 (http), 443 (https), 25 (smtp), 22 (ssh).

**Base Domain Name**: The portion of an applied-for FQDN that is the first Domain Name node left of a registry-controlled or public suffix plus the registry-controlled or public suffix (e.g. "example.co.uk" or "example.com"). For FQDNs where the right-most Domain Name node is a gTLD having ICANN Specification 13 in its registry agreement, the gTLD itself may be used as the Base Domain Name.

**CAA**: From RFC 8659 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659>): "The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name. CAA Resource Records allow a public CA to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue."

**CA Key Pair**: A Key Pair where the Public Key appears as the Subject Public Key Info in one or more Root CA Certificate(s) and/or Subordinate CA Certificate(s).

**Domain Label**: From RFC 8499 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8499>): "An ordered list of zero or more octets that makes up a portion of a domain name. Using graph theory, a label identifies one node in a portion of the graph of all possible domain names."

**Domain Name**: An ordered list of one or more Domain Labels assigned to a node in the Domain Name System.

**Domain Namespace**: The set of all possible Domain Names that are subordinate to a single node in the Domain Name System.

**Domain Name Registrant**: Sometimes referred to as the "owner" of a Domain Name, but more properly the person(s) or entity(ies) registered with a Domain Name Registrar as having the right to control how a Domain Name is used, such as the natural person or Legal Entity that is listed as the "Registrant" by WHOIS or the Domain Name Registrar.

**Domain Name Registrar**: A person or entity that registers Domain Names under the auspices of or by agreement with:

**Pending Prohibition​​**: The use of a behavior described with this label is highly discouraged, as it is planned to be deprecated and will likely be designated as MUST NOT in the future.

**Private Key**: The key of a Key Pair that is kept secret by the holder of the Key Pair, and that is used to create Digital Signatures and/or to decrypt electronic records or files that were encrypted with the corresponding Public Key.

**Public Key**: The key of a Key Pair that may be publicly disclosed by the holder of the corresponding Private Key and that is used by a Relying Party to verify Digital Signatures created with the holder's corresponding Private Key and/or to encrypt messages so that they can be decrypted only with the holder's corresponding Private Key.

**Public Key Infrastructure**: A set of hardware, software, people, procedures, rules, policies, and obligations used to facilitate the trustworthy creation, issuance, management, and use of Certificates and keys based on Public Key Cryptography.

**Publicly-Trusted Certificate**: A Certificate that is trusted by virtue of the fact that its corresponding Root Certificate is distributed as a trust anchor in widely-available application software.

**Random Value**: A value specified by a CA to the Applicant that exhibits at least 112 bits of entropy.

**Registered Domain Name**: A Domain Name that has been registered with a Domain Name Registrar.

**Registration Authority (RA)**: Any Legal Entity that is responsible for identification and authentication of subjects of Certificates, but is not a CA, and hence does not sign or issue Certificates. An RA may assist in the certificate application process or revocation process or both. When "RA" is used as an adjective to describe a role or function, it does not necessarily imply a separate body, but can be part of the CA.

**Reliable Data Source**: An identification document or source of data used to verify Subject Identity Information that is generally recognized among commercial enterprises and governments as reliable, and which was created by a third party for a purpose other than the Applicant obtaining a Certificate.

**Reliable Method of Communication**: A method of communication, such as a postal/courier delivery address, telephone number, or email address, that was verified using a source other than the Applicant Representative.

**Relying Party**: Any natural person or Legal Entity that relies on a Valid Certificate. An Application Software Supplier is not considered a Relying Party when software distributed by such Supplier merely displays information relating to a Certificate.

**Repository**: An online database containing publicly-disclosed PKI governance documents (such as Certificate Policies and Certification Practice Statements) and Certificate status information, either in the form of a CRL or an OCSP response.

**Request Token**: A value, derived in a method specified by the CA which binds this demonstration of control to the certificate request. The CA SHOULD define within its CPS (or a document clearly referenced by the CPS) the format and method of Request Tokens it accepts.

The Request Token SHALL incorporate the key used in the certificate request.

A Request Token MAY include a timestamp to indicate when it was created.

A Request Token MAY include other information to ensure its uniqueness.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future.

A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA SHALL NOT re-use it for a subsequent validation.

The binding SHALL use a digital signature algorithm or a cryptographic hash algorithm at least as strong as that to be used in signing the certificate request.

**Note**: Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to:

  i. a hash of the public key; or
  ii. a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; or
  iii. a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR.

A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data. If a CA wanted to always use a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR as a Request Token and did not want to incorporate a timestamp and did want to allow certificate key re-use then the applicant might use the challenge password in the creation of a CSR with OpenSSL to ensure uniqueness even if the subject and key are identical between subsequent requests.

**Note**: This simplistic shell command produces a Request Token which has a timestamp and a hash of a CSR.
  ``echo `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M` `sha256sum <r2.csr` \| sed "s/[ -]//g"``
The script outputs:
  201602251811c9c863405fe7675a3988b97664ea6baf442019e4e52fa335f406f7c5f26cf14f

**Short-lived Subscriber Certificate**: For Certificates issued on or after 15 March 2024 and prior to 15 March 2026, a Subscriber Certificate with a Validity Period less than or equal to 10 days (864,000 seconds). For Certificates issued on or after 15 March 2026, a Subscriber Certificate with a Validity Period less than or equal to 7 days (604,800 seconds).

**Sovereign State**: A state or country that administers its own government, and is not dependent upon, or subject to, another power.

**Subject**: The natural person, device, system, unit, or Legal Entity identified in a Certificate as the Subject. The Subject is either the Subscriber or a device under the control and operation of the Subscriber.

**Subsidiary Company**: A company that is controlled by a Parent Company.

**Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate**: A Subordinate CA certificate which uses a combination of Extended Key Usage and/or Name Constraint extensions, as defined within the relevant Certificate Profiles of this document, to limit the scope within which the Subordinate CA Certificate may issue Subscriber or additional Subordinate CA Certificates.

**Terms of Use**: Provisions regarding the safekeeping and acceptable uses of a Certificate issued in accordance with these Requirements when the Applicant/Subscriber is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.

**Test Certificate**: This term is no longer used in these Baseline Requirements.

Confirming the Applicant's control over the IP Address by performing the procedure documented for a “tls-alpn-01” challenge in RFC 8738.

#### 3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation

Before issuing a Wildcard Certificate, the CA MUST establish and follow a documented procedure that determines if the FQDN portion of any
Wildcard Domain Name in the Certificate is “registry-controlled” or is a “public suffix” (e.g. “\*.com”, “\*.co.uk”, see RFC 6454 Section 8.2 for further explanation).

If the FQDN portion of any Wildcard Domain Name is "registry-controlled" or is a "public suffix", CAs MUST refuse issuance unless the Applicant proves its rightful control of the entire Domain Namespace. (e.g. CAs MUST NOT issue "\*.co.uk" or "\*.local", but MAY issue "\*.example.com" to Example Co.).

Determination of what is "registry-controlled" versus the registerable portion of a Country Code Top-Level Domain Namespace is not standardized at the time of writing and is not a property of the DNS itself. Current best practice is to consult a "public suffix list" such as the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](<http://publicsuffix.org/>), and to retrieve a fresh copy regularly.

If using the PSL, a CA SHOULD consult the "ICANN DOMAINS" section only, not the "PRIVATE DOMAINS" section. The PSL is updated regularly to contain new gTLDs delegated by ICANN, which are listed in the "ICANN DOMAINS" section. A CA is not prohibited from issuing a Wildcard Certificate to the Registrant of an entire gTLD, provided that control of the entire namespace is demonstrated in an appropriate way.

#### 3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy

Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA SHALL evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The CA SHOULD consider the following during its evaluation:

1. The age of the information provided,
2. The frequency of updates to the information source,
3. The data provider and purpose of the data collection,
4. The public accessibility of the data availability, and
5. The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

Databases maintained by the CA, its owner, or its affiliated companies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under this [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

#### 3.2.2.8 CAA Records

As part of the Certificate issuance process, the CA MUST retrieve and process CAA records in accordance with RFC 8659 for each `dNSName` in the `subjectAltName` extension that does not contain an Onion Domain Name. If the CA issues, they MUST do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.

This stipulation does not prevent the CA from checking CAA records at any other time.

When processing CAA records, CAs MUST process the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags as specified in RFC 8659, although they are not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags MAY be supported, but MUST NOT conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this document. CAs MUST respect the critical flag and not issue a certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property tag with this flag set.

RFC 8659 requires that CAs "MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA determines that either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA RRset or (2) an exception specified in the relevant CP or CPS applies." For issuances conforming to these Baseline Requirements, CAs MUST NOT rely on any exceptions specified in their CP or CPS unless they are one of the following:

* CAA checking is optional for certificates for which a Certificate Transparency Precertificate (see [Section 7.1.2.9](#7129-precertificate-profile)) was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which CAA was checked at time of Precertificate issuance.
* CAA checking is optional for certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate as set out in [Section 7.1.2.3](#7123-technically-constrained-non-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile) or [Section 7.1.2.5](#7125-technically-constrained-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual provision in the contract with the Applicant.
* For certificates issued prior to July 1, 2021, CAA checking is optional if the CA or an Affiliate of the CA is the DNS Operator (as defined in RFC 7719) of the domain's DNS.

CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:

* the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and
* the lookup has been retried at least once; and
* the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.

CAs MUST document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to the CAB Forum on the circumstances, and SHOULD dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

If an Applicant subject to this [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-individual-identity) is a natural person, then the CA SHALL verify the Applicant's name, Applicant's address, and the authenticity of the certificate request.

The CA SHALL verify the Applicant's name using a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Applicant's face, of at least one currently valid government-issued photo ID (passport, drivers license, military ID, national ID, or equivalent document type). The CA SHALL inspect the copy for any indication of alteration or falsification.

The CA SHALL verify the Applicant's address using a form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable, such as a government ID, utility bill, or bank or credit card statement. The CA MAY rely on the same government-issued ID that was used to verify the Applicant's name.

The CA SHALL verify the certificate request with the Applicant using a Reliable Method of Communication.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

If the Applicant for a Certificate containing Subject Identity Information is an organization, the CA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authenticity of the Applicant Representative's certificate request.

The CA MAY use the sources listed in [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-identity) to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA MAY establish the authenticity of the certificate request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the CA deems appropriate.

In addition, the CA SHALL establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may request Certificates. If an Applicant specifies, in writing, the individuals who may request a Certificate, then the CA SHALL NOT accept any certificate requests that are outside this specification. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized certificate requesters upon the Applicant's verified written request.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation or Certification

The CA SHALL disclose all Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificates that identify the CA as the Subject, provided that the CA arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship (i.e. the Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate at issue).

# 4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Certificate Application

### 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application

No stipulation.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain the following documentation from the Applicant:

1. A certificate request, which may be electronic; and
2. An executed Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, which may be electronic.

The CA SHOULD obtain any additional documentation the CA determines necessary to meet these Requirements.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain from the Applicant a certificate request in a form prescribed by the CA and that complies with these Requirements. One certificate request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the aging and updating requirement in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current certificate request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. The certificate request MAY be made, submitted and/or signed electronically.

The certificate request MUST contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant for the issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

The certificate request MAY include all factual information about the Applicant to be included in the Certificate, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with these Requirements and the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. In cases where the certificate request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA SHALL obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA SHALL establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

Applicant information MUST include, but not be limited to, at least one Fully-Qualified Domain Name or IP address to be included in the Certificate's `subjectAltName` extension.

[Section 6.3.2](#632-certificate-operational-periods-and-key-pair-usage-periods) limits the validity period of Subscriber Certificates. The CA MAY use the documents and data provided in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or completed the validation itself no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate. For validation of Domain Names and IP Addresses according to Section 3.2.2.4 and 3.2.2.5, any data, document, or completed validation used MUST be obtained no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

In no case may a prior validation be reused if any data or document used in the prior validation was obtained more than the maximum time permitted for reuse of the data or document prior to issuing the Certificate.

After the change to any validation method specified in the Baseline Requirements or EV Guidelines, a CA may continue to reuse validation data or documents collected prior to the change, or the validation itself, for the period stated in this BR 4.2.1 unless otherwise specifically provided in a ballot.

The CA SHALL develop, maintain, and implement documented procedures that identify and require additional verification activity for High Risk Certificate Requests prior to the Certificate's approval, as reasonably necessary to ensure that such requests are properly verified under these Requirements.

If a Delegated Third Party fulfills any of the CA's obligations under this section , the CA SHALL verify that the process used by the Delegated Third Party to identify and further verify High Risk Certificate Requests provides at least the same level of assurance as the CA's own processes.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

CAs SHALL NOT issue certificates containing Internal Names or Reserved IP Addresses, as such names cannot be validated according to [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control) or [Section 3.2.2.5](#3225-authentication-for-an-ip-address).

### 4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications

No stipulation.

## 4.3 Certificate issuance

### 4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance

#### 4.3.1.1 Manual authorization of certificate issuance for Root CAs

Certificate issuance by the Root CA SHALL require an individual authorized by the CA (i.e. the CA system operator, system officer, or PKI administrator) to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform a certificate signing operation.

#### 4.3.1.2 Linting of to-be-signed Certificate content

Due to the complexity in implementing the certificate-formatting standards of these Requirements when issuing publicly-trusted Certificates, before a Certificate or Pre-certificate is issued, the CA SHOULD implement a Linting process to test the technical conformity of the Certificate to be issued with these Requirements.

Methods used to produce a certificate containing to-be-signed Certificate content include, but are not limited to:

1. Sign the `tbsCertificate` with a "dummy" Private Key whose Public Key component is not certified by a Certificate that chains to a publicly-trusted CA Certificate; or
2. Specify a static value for the `signature` field of the Certificate ASN.1 SEQUENCE.

CAs MAY implement their own certificate Linting tools, but CAs SHOULD use (and help improve) the Linting tools that have been widely adopted by the industry (see https://cabforum.org/resources/tools/).

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

#### 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate

The CA MAY support revocation of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates.

With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, the CA SHALL revoke a Certificate within 24 hours and use the corresponding CRLReason (see Section 7.2.2) if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subscriber requests in writing, without specifying a CRLreason, that the CA revoke the Certificate (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);
2. The Subscriber notifies the CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
3. The CA obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);
4. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>) (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);
5. The CA obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any Fully-Qualified Domain Name or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon (CRLReason #4, superseded).

With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, the CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding CRLReason (see Section 7.2.2) if one or more of the following occurs:

6. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking) (CRLReason #4, superseded);
7. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
8. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
9. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name or IP address in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name) (CRLReason #5, cessationOfOperation);
10. The CA is made aware that a Wildcard Certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate Fully-Qualified Domain Name (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
11. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
12. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement (CRLReason #4, superseded);
13. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);
14. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);
15. Revocation is required by the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement for a reason that is not otherwise required to be specified by this section 4.9.1.1 (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or
16. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise).

#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate

The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
4. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
5. The Issuing CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
6. The Issuing CA determines that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;
7. The Issuing CA or Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide revocation support for the Certificate;
8. The Issuing CA's or Subordinate CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository; or
9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

No stipulation.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, the CA SHALL investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.
After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA SHALL work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which the CA will revoke the certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation MUST NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate). The date selected by the CA SHOULD consider the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

No stipulation.

**Note**: Following certificate issuance, a certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in [Section 4.9](#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension). Therefore, relying parties should check the revocation status of all certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

CRLs must be available via a publicly-accessible HTTP URL (i.e., "published").

Within twenty-four (24) hours of issuing its first Certificate, the CA MUST generate and publish either:
- a full and complete CRL; OR
- partitioned (i.e., "sharded") CRLs that, when aggregated, represent the equivalent of a full and complete CRL.

CAs issuing Subscriber Certificates:  
1. MUST update and publish a new CRL at least every: 
     - seven (7) days if all Certificates include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod (“AIA OCSP pointer”); or
     - four (4) days in all other cases; 
2. MUST update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours after recording a Certificate as revoked.

CAs issuing CA Certificates:  
1. MUST update and publish a new CRL at least every twelve (12) months;
2. MUST update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours after recording a Certificate as revoked.

CAs MUST continue issuing CRLs until one of the following is true:
- all Subordinate CA Certificates containing the same Subject Public Key are expired or revoked; OR
- the corresponding Subordinate CA Private Key is destroyed.


### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs (if applicable)

No stipulation.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

The following SHALL apply for communicating the status of Certificates which include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
revocation status is being checked.

In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as
defined by RFC6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

The following SHALL apply for communicating the status of Certificates which include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019. The CA MAY process the Nonce extension (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2`) in accordance with RFC 8954.

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the `thisUpdate` and `nextUpdate` field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:

1. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours;
2. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days;
3. For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one-half of the validity period before the nextUpdate.
4. For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:

* The CA SHALL update information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol

  i. at least every twelve months; and
  ii. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder SHOULD NOT respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.2.3](#7123-technically-constrained-non-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile) or [Section 7.1.2.5](#7125-technically-constrained-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), the responder MUST NOT respond with a "good" status for such requests.

The OCSP responder MAY provide definitive responses about "reserved" certificate serial numbers, as if there was a corresponding Certificate that matches the Precertificate [RFC6962].

A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is one of the following three options:

1. "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject; or
2. "reserved" if a Precertificate [RFC6962] with that serial number has been issued by
   a. the Issuing CA; or
   b. a Precertificate Signing Certificate, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile), associated with the Issuing CA; or
3. "unused" if neither of the previous conditions are met.

# 6. TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

## 6.1 Key pair generation and installation

### 6.1.1 Key pair generation

#### 6.1.1.1 CA Key Pair Generation

For CA Key Pairs that are either

  i. used as a CA Key Pair for a Root Certificate or
  ii. used as a CA Key Pair for a Subordinate CA Certificate, where the Subordinate CA is not the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA,

the CA SHALL:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script,
2. have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process, and
3. have a Qualified Auditor issue a report opining that the CA followed its key ceremony during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.

For other CA Key Pairs that are for the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA, the CA SHOULD:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script and
2. have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process.

In all cases, the CA SHALL:

1. generate the CA Key Pair in a physically secured environment as described in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
2. generate the CA Key Pair using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;
3. generate the CA Key Pair within cryptographic modules meeting the applicable technical and business requirements as disclosed in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
4. log its CA Key Pair generation activities; and
5. maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement and (if applicable) its Key Generation Script.

#### 6.1.1.2 RA Key Pair Generation

#### 6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation

The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and/or [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
2. There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;
3. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;
4. The CA has previously been made aware that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise, such as through the provisions of [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate);
5. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method to easily compute the Applicant's Private Key based on the Public Key (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>).

If the Subscriber Certificate will contain an `extKeyUsage` extension containing either the values `id-kp-serverAuth` [RFC5280] or `anyExtendedKeyUsage` [RFC5280], the CA SHALL NOT generate a Key Pair on behalf of a Subscriber, and SHALL NOT accept a certificate request using a Key Pair previously generated by the CA.

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber

Parties other than the Subscriber SHALL NOT archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an organization not affiliated with the Subscriber, then the CA SHALL revoke all certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

### 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties

### 6.1.5 Key sizes

For RSA key pairs the CA SHALL:

* Ensure that the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits, and;
* Ensure that the modulus size, in bits, is evenly divisible by 8.

For ECDSA key pairs, the CA SHALL:

* Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the NIST P-256, NIST P-384 or NIST P-521 elliptic curve.

No other algorithms or key sizes are permitted.

### 6.1.6 Public key parameters generation and quality checking

RSA: The CA SHALL confirm that the value of the public exponent is an odd number equal to 3 or more. Additionally, the public exponent SHOULD be in the range between 2^16 + 1 and 2^256 - 1. The modulus SHOULD also have the following characteristics: an odd number, not the power of a prime, and have no factors smaller than 752. [Source: Section 5.3.3, NIST SP 800-89]

ECDSA: The CA SHOULD confirm the validity of all keys using either the ECC Full Public Key Validation Routine or the ECC Partial Public Key Validation Routine. [Source: Sections 5.6.2.3.2 and 5.6.2.3.3, respectively, of NIST SP 800-56A: Revision 2]

### 6.1.7 Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field)

Private Keys corresponding to Root Certificates MUST NOT be used to sign Certificates except in the following cases:

1. Self-signed Certificates to represent the Root CA itself;
2. Certificates for Subordinate CAs and Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificates;
3. Certificates for infrastructure purposes (administrative role certificates, internal CA operational device certificates); and
4. Certificates for OCSP Response verification.

## 6.2 Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls

The CA SHALL implement physical and logical safeguards to prevent unauthorized certificate issuance. Protection of the CA Private Key outside the validated system or device specified in [Section 6.2.7](#627-private-key-storage-on-cryptographic-module) MUST consist of physical security, encryption, or a combination of both, implemented in a manner that prevents disclosure of the Private Key. The CA SHALL encrypt its Private Key with an algorithm and key-length that, according to the state of the art, are capable of withstanding cryptanalytic attacks for the residual life of the encrypted key or key part.

### 6.2.5 Private key archival

Parties other than the Subordinate CA SHALL NOT archive the Subordinate CA Private Keys without authorization by the Subordinate CA.

### 6.2.6 Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module

If the Issuing CA generated the Private Key on behalf of the Subordinate CA, then the Issuing CA SHALL encrypt the Private Key for transport to the Subordinate CA. If the Issuing CA becomes aware that a Subordinate CA's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an organization not affiliated with the Subordinate CA, then the Issuing CA SHALL revoke all certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### 6.2.7 Private key storage on cryptographic module

The CA SHALL protect its Private Key in a system or device that has been validated as meeting at least FIPS 140-2 level 3, FIPS 140-3 level 3, or an appropriate Common Criteria Protection Profile or Security Target, EAL 4 (or higher), which includes requirements to protect the Private Key and other assets against known threats.

In addition to the above, extKeyUsage extension requirements vary based on the relationship between the Issuer and Subject organizations represented in the Cross-Certificate.

The extKeyUsage extension MAY be "unrestricted" as described in the following table if:
- the organizationName represented in the Issuer and Subject names of the corresponding certificate are either:
   - the same, or
   - the organizationName represented in the Subject name is an affiliate of the organizationName represented in the Issuer name
- the corresponding CA represented by the Subject of the Cross-Certificate is operated by the same organization as the Issuing CA or an Affiliate of the Issuing CA organization.

| __Key Purpose__        | __Description__ |
| ---                    | -------         |
| `anyExtendedKeyUsage`  | The special extended key usage to indicate there are no restrictions applied. If present, this MUST be the only key usage present. |
| Any other value        | CAs MUST NOT include any other key usage with the `anyExtendedKeyUsage` key usage present. |

Alternatively, if the Issuing CA does not use this form, then the Extended Key Usage extension, if present, MUST be encoded as specified in [Section 7.1.2.2.5](#71225-cross-certified-subordinate-ca-extended-key-usage---restricted).

| Any other value        | MAY be present.|

Each included Extended Key Usage key usage purpose:

  1. MUST apply in the context of the public Internet (e.g. MUST NOT be for a service that is only valid in a privately managed network), unless:
     a. the key usage purpose falls within an OID arc for which the Applicant demonstrates ownership; or,
     b. the Applicant can otherwise demonstrate the right to assert the key usage purpose in a public context.
  2. MUST NOT include semantics that will mislead the Relying Party about the certificate information verified by the CA, such as including a key usage purpose asserting storage on a smart card, where the CA is not able to verify that the corresponding Private Key is confined to such hardware due to remote issuance.
  3. MUST be verified by the Issuing CA (i.e. the Issuing CA MUST verify the Cross-Certified Subordinate CA is authorized to assert the key usage purpose).

CAs MUST NOT include additional key usage purposes unless the CA is aware of a reason for including the key usage purpose in the Certificate.

|     Any other identifier | MAY             | If present, MUST be documented by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. |
| `policyQualifiers`       | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST contain only permitted `policyQualifiers` from the table below. |

##### 7.1.2.3.3 Technically Constrained Non-TLS Subordinate CA Extended Key Usage

The Issuing CA MUST verify that the Subordinate CA Certificate is authorized to issue certificates for each included extended key usage purpose. Multiple, independent key purposes (e.g. `id-kp-timeStamping` and `id-kp-codeSigning`) are NOT RECOMMENDED.

| __Key Purpose__                    | __OID__                 | __Presence__ |
| ----                               | ----                    | -            |

#### 7.1.2.4 Technically Constrained Precertificate Signing CA Certificate Profile

This Certificate Profile MUST be used when issuing a CA Certificate that will be used as a Precertificate Signing CA, as described in [RFC 6962, Section 3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-3.1). If a CA Certificate conforms to this profile, it is considered Technically Constrained.

A Precertificate Signing CA MUST only be used to sign Precertificates, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.9](#7129-precertificate-profile). When a Precertificate Signing CA issues a Precertificate, it shall be interpreted as if the Issuing CA of the Precertificate Signing CA has issued a Certificate with a matching `tbsCertificate` of the Precertificate, after applying the modifications specified in [RFC 6962, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-3.2).

As noted in RFC 6962, Section 3.2, the `signature` field of a Precertificate is not altered as part of these modifications. As such, the Precertificate Signing CA MUST use the same signature algorithm as the Issuing CA when issuing Precertificates, and, correspondingly, MUST use a public key of the same public key algorithm as the Issuing CA, although MAY use a different CA Key Pair.

##### 7.1.2.5.2 Technically Constrained TLS Subordinate CA Name Constraints

For a TLS Subordinate CA to be Technically Constrained, Name Constraints extension MUST be encoded as follows. As an explicit exception from RFC 5280, this extension SHOULD be marked critical, but MAY be marked non-critical if compatibility with certain legacy applications that do not support Name Constraints is necessary.

| `dNSName`       | MUST            | The CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has registered the `dNSName` or has been authorized by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf. See [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control). | If at least one `dNSName` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MAY indicate one or more subordinate domains to be excluded. | If no `dNSName` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, then the CA MUST include a zero-length `dNSName` to indicate no domain names are permitted. |
| `iPAddress`     | MUST            | The CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has been assigned the `iPAddress` range or has been authorized by the assigner to act on the asignee's behalf. See [Section 3.2.2.5](#3225-authentication-for-an-ip-address). | If at least one `iPAddress` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MAY indicate one or more subdivisions of those ranges to be excluded. | If no IPv4 `iPAddress` is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MUST include an `iPAddress` of 8 zero octets, indicating the IPv4 range of 0.0.0.0/0 being excluded. If no IPv6 `iPAddress` is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MUST include an `iPAddress` of 32 zero octets, indicating the IPv6 range of ::0/0 being excluded. |
| `directoryName` | MUST            | The CA MUST confirm the Applicant's and/or Subsidiary's name attributes such that all certificates issued will comply with the relevant Certificate Profile (see [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions)), including Name Forms (See [Section 7.1.4](#714-name-forms)). | It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include values within `excludedSubtrees`. | The CA MUST include a value within `permittedSubtrees`, and as such, this does not apply.

Any `otherName`, if present:

  1. MUST apply in the context of the public Internet, unless:
     a. the `type-id` falls within an OID arc for which the Applicant demonstrates ownership, or,
     b. the Applicant can otherwise demonstrate the right to assert the data in a public context.
  2. MUST NOT include semantics that will mislead the Relying Party about certificate information verified by the CA.
  3. MUST be DER encoded according to the relevant ASN.1 module defining the `otherName` `type-id` and `value`.

CAs SHALL NOT include additional names unless the CA is aware of a reason for including the data in the Certificate.

##### 7.1.2.7.1 Subscriber Certificate Types

There are four types of Subscriber Certificates that may be issued, which vary based on the amount of Subject Information that is included.  Each of these certificate types shares a common profile, with three exceptions: the `subject` name fields that may occur, how those fields are validated, and the contents of the `certificatePolicies` extension. 

| __Type__                    | __Description__                                       |
| ---                         | -------                                                |
| Domain Validated (DV)       | See [Section 7.1.2.7.2](#71272-domain-validated)       |
| Individual Validated (IV)   | See [Section 7.1.2.7.3](#71273-individual-validated)   |
| Organization Validated (OV) | See [Section 7.1.2.7.4](#71274-organization-validated) |
| Extended Validation (EV)    | See [Section 7.1.2.7.5](#71275-extended-validation)    |

**Note**: Although each Subscriber Certificate type varies in Subject Information, all Certificates provide the same level of assurance of the device identity (domain name and/or IP address).

##### 7.1.2.7.2 Domain Validated

For a Subscriber Certificate to be Domain Validated, it MUST meet the following profile:

| __Field__             | __Requirements__     |

##### 7.1.2.7.5 Extended Validation

For a Subscriber Certificate to be Extended Validation, it MUST comply with the Certificate Profile specified in the then-current version of the Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates.
 In addition, it MUST meet the following profile:

| __Field__             | __Requirements__     |
| --                    | -------              |

**Notes**: 
- whether or not the `subjectAltName` extension should be marked Critical depends on the contents of the Certificate's `subject` field, as detailed in [Section 7.1.2.7.12](#712712-subscriber-certificate-subject-alternative-name).
- whether or not the CRL Distribution Points extension must be present depends on 1) whether the Certificate includes an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod and 2) the Certificate's validity period, as detailed in [Section 7.1.2.11.2](#712112-crl-distribution-points).

##### 7.1.2.7.7 Subscriber Certificate Authority Information Access

The `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MUST contain one or more `AccessDescription`s. Each `AccessDescription` MUST only contain a permitted `accessMethod`, as detailed below, and each `accessLocation` MUST be encoded as the specified `GeneralName` type.

The `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MAY contain multiple `AccessDescription`s with the same `accessMethod`, if permitted for that `accessMethod`. When multiple `AccessDescription`s are present with the same `accessMethod`, each `accessLocation` MUST be unique, and each `AccessDescription` MUST be ordered in priority for that `accessMethod`, with the most-preferred `accessLocation` being the first `AccessDescription`. No ordering requirements are given for `AccessDescription`s that contain different `accessMethod`s, provided that previous requirement is satisfied.

| __Access Method__ | __OID__            | __Access Location__         | __Presence__ | __Maximum__ | __Description__ |
| --                | --                 | ----                        | -            | -          | ---             |

| `id-ad-caIssuers` | 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2 | `uniformResourceIdentifier` | SHOULD       | \*         | A HTTP URL of the Issuing CA's certificate. |
| Any other value   | -                  | -                           | MUST NOT     | -          | No other `accessMethod`s may be used. |

##### 7.1.2.7.8 Subscriber Certificate Basic Constraints

| __Field__           | __Description__ |
| ---                 | ------- |
| `cA`                | MUST be FALSE |
| `pathLenConstraint` | MUST NOT be present |

##### 7.1.2.7.9 Subscriber Certificate Certificate Policies

If present, the Certificate Policies extension MUST contain at least one `PolicyInformation`. Each `PolicyInformation` MUST match the following profile:

| __Field__                | __Presence__    | __Contents__ |
| ---                      | -               | ------       |
| `policyIdentifier`       | MUST            | One of the following policy identifiers: |
|     A [Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) | MUST | The Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier (see [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers)) associated with the given Subscriber Certificate type (see [Section 7.1.2.7.1](#71271-subscriber-certificate-types)). |
|     `anyPolicy`          | MUST NOT        | The `anyPolicy` Policy Identifier MUST NOT be present. |
|     Any other identifier | MAY             | If present, MUST be defined and documented in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. |
| `policyQualifiers`       | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST contain only permitted `policyQualifiers` from the table below. |


This Profile RECOMMENDS that the first `PolicyInformation` value within the Certificate Policies extension contains the Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier (see [7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers))[^first_policy_note]. Regardless of the order of `PolicyInformation` values, the Certificate Policies extension MUST contain exactly one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier.


Table: Permitted `policyQualifiers`

| __Qualifier ID__                     | __Presence__ | __Field Type__ |  __Contents__ |
| ---                                  | -            | -              | -----         |
| `id-qt-cps` (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.2.1) | MAY          | `IA5String`    | The HTTP or HTTPS URL for the Issuing CA's Certificate Policies, Certification Practice Statement, Relying Party Agreement, or other pointer to online policy information provided by the Issuing CA. |
| Any other qualifier                  | MUST NOT     | -              | -             |

[^first_policy_note]: Although RFC 5280 allows `PolicyInformation`s to appear in any order, several client implementations have implemented logic that considers the `policyIdentifier` that matches a given filter. As such, ensuring the Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier is the first `PolicyInformation` reduces the risk of interoperability challenges.

##### 7.1.2.7.10 Subscriber Certificate Extended Key Usage

| __Key Purpose__                    | __OID__                 | __Presence__    |

| `anyExtendedKeyUsage`              | 2.5.29.37.0             | MUST NOT        |
| Precertificate Signing Certificate | 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.4 | MUST NOT        |
| Any other value                    | -                       | NOT RECOMMENDED |

##### 7.1.2.7.11 Subscriber Certificate Key Usage

The acceptable Key Usage values vary based on whether the Certificate's `subjectPublicKeyInfo` identifies an RSA public key or an ECC public key. CAs MUST ensure the Key Usage is appropriate for the Certificate Public Key.

Table: Key Usage for RSA Public Keys

| __Key Usage__      | __Permitted__ | __Required__     |
| ----               | -             | -                |
| `digitalSignature` | Y             | SHOULD           |
| `nonRepudiation`   | N             | --               |
| `keyEncipherment`  | Y             | MAY              |
| `dataEncipherment` | Y             | NOT RECOMMENDED  |
| `keyAgreement`     | N             | --               |
| `keyCertSign`      | N             | --               |
| `cRLSign`          | N             | --               |
| `encipherOnly`     | N             | --               |
| `decipherOnly`     | N             | --               |

**Note**: At least one Key Usage MUST be set for RSA Public Keys. The `digitalSignature` bit is REQUIRED for use with modern protocols, such as TLS 1.3, and secure ciphersuites, while the `keyEncipherment` bit MAY be asserted to support older protocols, such as TLS 1.2, when using insecure ciphersuites. Subscribers MAY wish to ensure key separation to limit the risk from such legacy protocols, and thus a CA MAY issue a Subscriber certificate that only asserts the `keyEncipherment` bit. For most Subscribers, the `digitalSignature` bit is sufficient, while Subscribers that want to mix insecure and secure ciphersuites with the same algorithm may choose to assert both `digitalSignature` and `keyEncipherment` within the same certificate, although this is NOT RECOMMENDED. The `dataEncipherment` bit is currently permitted, although setting it is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is a Pending Prohibition (https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/384).

Table: Key Usage for ECC Public Keys

| __Key Usage__      | __Permitted__ | __Required__     |
| ----               | -             | -                |
| `digitalSignature` | Y             | MUST             |
| `nonRepudiation`   | N             | --               |
| `keyEncipherment`  | N             | --               |
| `dataEncipherment` | N             | --               |
| `keyAgreement`     | Y             | NOT RECOMMENDED  |
| `keyCertSign`      | N             | --               |
| `cRLSign`          | N             | --               |
| `encipherOnly`     | N             | --               |
| `decipherOnly`     | N             | --               |

**Note**: The `keyAgreement` bit is currently permitted, although setting it is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is a Pending Prohibition (https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/384).

##### 7.1.2.7.12 Subscriber Certificate Subject Alternative Name

For Subscriber Certificates, the Subject Alternative Name MUST be present and MUST contain at least one `dNSName` or `iPAddress` `GeneralName`. See below for further requirements about the permitted fields and their validation requirements.

If the `subject` field of the certificate is an empty SEQUENCE, this extension MUST be marked critical, as specified in [RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6). Otherwise, this extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

Table: `GeneralName` within a `subjectAltName` extension

Wildcard Domain Names MUST be validated for consistency with [Section 3.2.2.6](#3226-wildcard-domain-validation). The entry MUST NOT contain an Internal Name. The Fully-Qualified Domain Name or the FQDN portion of the Wildcard Domain Name contained in the entry MUST be composed entirely of P-Labels or Non-Reserved LDH Labels joined together by a U+002E FULL STOP (".") character. The zero-length Domain Label representing the root zone of the Internet Domain Name System MUST NOT be included (e.g. "example.com" MUST be encoded as "example.com" and MUST NOT be encoded as "example.com."). |

The entry MUST NOT contain a Reserved IP Address. |
| `registeredID`              | N             | -              |

#### 7.1.2.8 OCSP Responder Certificate Profile

If the Issuing CA does not directly sign OCSP responses, it MAY make use of an OCSP Authorized Responder, as defined by [RFC 6960](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#section-4.2.2.2). The Issuing CA of the Responder MUST be the same as the Issuing CA for the Certificates it provides responses for.

##### 7.1.2.8.3 OCSP Responder Authority Information Access

For OCSP Responder certificates, this extension is NOT RECOMMENDED, as the Relying Party should already possess the necessary information. In order to validate the given Responder certificate, the Relying Party must have access to the Issuing CA's certificate, eliminating the need to provide `id-ad-caIssuers`. Similarly, because of the requirement for an OCSP Responder certificate to include the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension, it is not necessary to provide `id-ad-ocsp`, as such responses will not be checked by Relying Parties.

If present, the `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MUST contain one or more `AccessDescription`s. Each `AccessDescription` MUST only contain a permitted `accessMethod`, as detailed below, and each `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MUST contain all required `AccessDescription`s.

| __Access Method__ | __OID__            | __Access Location__         | __Presence__    | __Maximum__ | __Description__ |
| --                | --                 | ----                        | -               | -          | ---             |
| `id-ad-ocsp`      | 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 | `uniformResourceIdentifier` | NOT RECOMMENDED | \*         | A HTTP URL of the Issuing CA's OCSP responder. |
| Any other value   | -                  | -                           | MUST NOT        | -          | No other `accessMethod`s may be used. |

##### 7.1.2.8.4 OCSP Responder Basic Constraints

OCSP Responder certificates MUST NOT be CA certificates. The issuing CA may indicate this one of two ways: by omission of the `basicConstraints` extension, or through the inclusion of a `basicConstraints` extension that sets the `cA` boolean to FALSE.

| __Field__           | __Description__ |
| ---                 | ------- |
| `cA`                | MUST be FALSE |
| `pathLenConstraint` | MUST NOT be present |

**Note**: Due to DER encoding rules regarding the encoding of DEFAULT values within OPTIONAL fields, a `basicConstraints` extension that sets the `cA` boolean to FALSE MUST have an `extnValue` `OCTET STRING` which is exactly the hex-encoded bytes `3000`, the encoded representation of an empty ASN.1 `SEQUENCE` value.

##### 7.1.2.8.5 OCSP Responder Extended Key Usage

| __Key Purpose__                    | __OID__                 | __Presence__ |
| ----                               | ----                    | -            |
| `id-kp-OCSPSigning`                | 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9       | MUST         |
| Any other value                    | -                       | MUST NOT     |

##### 7.1.2.8.6 OCSP Responder id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck

The CA MUST include the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5).

This extension MUST have an `extnValue` `OCTET STRING` which is exactly the hex-encoded bytes `0500`, the encoded representation of the ASN.1 NULL value, as specified in [RFC 6960, Section 4.2.2.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6960#section-4.2.2.2.1).

##### 7.1.2.8.7 OCSP Responder Key Usage

| __Key Usage__      | __Permitted__ | __Required__     |
| ----               | -             | -                |
| `digitalSignature` | Y             | Y                |

| `decipherOnly`     | N             | --               |

##### 7.1.2.8.8 OCSP Responder Certificate Policies

If present, the Certificate Policies extension MUST contain at least one `PolicyInformation`. Each `PolicyInformation` MUST match the following profile:

| __Field__                | __Presence__    | __Contents__ |
| ---                      | -               | ------       |
| `policyIdentifier`       | MUST            | One of the following policy identifiers: |
|     A [Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) | NOT RECOMMENDED | |
|     `anyPolicy`          | NOT RECOMMENDED | |
|     Any other identifier | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST be defined by the CA and documented by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. |
| `policyQualifiers`       | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST contain only permitted `policyQualifiers` from the table below. |


Table: Permitted `policyQualifiers`

| __Qualifier ID__                     | __Presence__ | __Field Type__ |  __Contents__ |
| ---                                  | -            | -              | -----         |
| `id-qt-cps` (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.2.1) | MAY          | `IA5String`    | The HTTP or HTTPS URL for the Issuing CA's Certificate Policies, Certification Practice Statement, Relying Party Agreement, or other pointer to online policy information provided by the Issuing CA. |
| Any other qualifier                  | MUST NOT     | -              | -             |


**Note**: See [Section 7.1.2.8.2](#71282-ocsp-responder-extensions) for applicable effective dates for when this extension may be included.

**Note**: Because the Certificate Policies extension may be used to restrict the applicable usages for a Certificate, incorrect policies may result in OCSP Responder Certificates that fail to successfully validate, resulting in invalid OCSP Responses. Including the `anyPolicy` policy can reduce this risk, but add to client processing complexity and interoperability issues.

#### 7.1.2.9 Precertificate Profile

A Precertificate is a signed data structure that can be submitted to a Certificate Transparency log, as defined by [RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962). A Precertificate appears structurally identical to a Certificate, with the exception of a special critical poison extension in the `extensions` field, with the OID of `1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.3`. This extension ensures that the Precertificate will not be accepted as a Certificate by clients conforming to [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280). The existence of a signed Precertificate can be treated as evidence of a corresponding Certificate also existing, as the signature represents a binding commitment by the CA that it may issue such a Certificate.

A Precertificate is created after a CA has decided to issue a Certificate, but prior to the actual signing of the Certificate. The CA MAY construct and sign a Precertificate corresponding to the Certificate, for purposes of submitting to Certificate Transparency Logs. The CA MAY use the returned Signed Certificate Timestamps to then alter the Certificate's `extensions` field, adding a Signed Certificate Timestamp List, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.11.3](#712113-signed-certificate-timestamp-list) and as permitted by the relevant profile, prior to signing the Certificate.

Once a Precertificate is signed, relying parties are permitted to treat this as a binding commitment from the CA of the intent to issue a corresponding Certificate, or more commonly, that a corresponding Certificate exists. A Certificate is said to be corresponding to a Precertificate based upon the value of the `tbsCertificate` contents, as transformed by the process defined in [RFC 6962, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962#section-3.2).

This profile describes the transformations that are permitted to a Certificate to construct a Precertificate. CAs MUST NOT issue a Precertificate unless they are willing to issue a corresponding Certificate, regardless of whether they have done so. Similarly, a CA MUST NOT issue a Precertificate unless the corresponding Certificate conforms to these Baseline Requirements, regardless of whether the CA signs the corresponding Certificate.

A Precertificate may be issued either directly by the Issuing CA or by a Technically Constrained Precertificate Signing CA, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile). If issued by a Precertificate Signing CA, then in addition to the precertificate poison and signed certificate timestamp list extensions, the Precertificate `issuer` field and, if present, `authorityKeyIdentifier` extension, may differ from the Certificate, as described below.


Table: When the Precertificate is issued directly by the Issuing CA

| __Field__                  | __Description__ |
| ---                        | ------          |
| `tbsCertificate`           | |
|     `version`              | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `version` field of the Certificate |
|     `serialNumber`         | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `serialNumber` field of the Certificate |
|     `signature`            | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `signature` field of the Certificate  |
|     `issuer`               | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `issuer` field of the Certificate |
|     `validity`             | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `validity` field of the Certificate |
|     `subject`              | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subject` field of the Certificate |
|     `subjectPublicKeyInfo` | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field of the Certificate |
|     `issuerUniqueID`       | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `issuerUniqueID` field of the Certificate, or omitted if omitted in the Certificate |
|     `subjectUniqueID`      | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subjectUniqueID` field of the Certificate, or omitted if omitted in the Certificate |
|     `extensions`           | See [Section 7.1.2.9.1](#71291-precertificate-profile-extensions---directly-issued) |
| `signatureAlgorithm`       | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `tbsCertificate.signature`. |
| `signature`                | |


Table: When the Precertificate is issued by a Precertificate Signing CA on behalf of an Issuing CA

| __Field__                  | __Description__ |
| ---                        | ------          |
| `tbsCertificate`           | |
|     `version`              | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `version` field of the Certificate |
|     `serialNumber`         | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `serialNumber` field of the Certificate |
|     `signature`            | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `signature` field of the Certificate  |
|     `issuer`               | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subject` field of the [Precertificate Signing CA Certificate](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile) |
|     `validity`             | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `validity` field of the Certificate |
|     `subject`              | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subject` field of the Certificate |
|     `subjectPublicKeyInfo` | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field of the Certificate |
|     `issuerUniqueID`       | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `issuerUniqueID` field of the Certificate, or omitted if omitted in the Certificate |
|     `subjectUniqueID`      | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `subjectUniqueID` field of the Certificate, or omitted if omitted in the Certificate |
|     `extensions`           | See [Section 7.1.2.9.2](#71292-precertificate-profile-extensions---precertificate-ca-issued) |
| `signatureAlgorithm`       | Encoded value MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `tbsCertificate.signature`. |
| `signature`                | |

**Note**: This profile requires that the `serialNumber` field of the Precertificate be identical to that of the corresponding Certificate. [RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.2) requires that the `serialNumber` of certificates be unique. For the purposes of this document, a Precertificate shall not be considered a "certificate" subject to that requirement, and thus may have the same `serialNumber` of the corresponding Certificate. However, this does not permit two Precertificates to share the same `serialNumber`, unless they correspond to the same Certificate, as this would otherwise indicate there are two corresponding Certificates that share the same `serialNumber`.

##### 7.1.2.9.1 Precertificate Profile Extensions - Directly Issued

These extensions apply in the context of a Precertificate directly issued from a CA, and not from a Precertificate Signing CA Certificate, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile).

| __Extension__                                        | __Presence__ | __Critical__ | __Description__ |
| ----                                                 | -            | -            | ----- |
| Precertificate Poison (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.3) | MUST         | Y            | See [Section 7.1.2.9.3](#71293-precertificate-poison) |
| Signed Certificate Timestamp List                    | MUST NOT     | -            | |
| Any other extension                                  | \*           | \*           | The order, criticality, and encoded values of all other extensions MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `extensions` field of the Certificate |

**Note**: This requirement is expressing that if the Precertificate Poison extension is removed from the Precertificate, and the Signed Certificate Timestamp List is removed from the certificate, the contents of the `extensions` field MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the Certificate.

##### 7.1.2.9.2 Precertificate Profile Extensions - Precertificate CA Issued

These extensions apply in the context of a Precertificate from a Precertificate Signing CA Certificate, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile). For such Precertificates, the `authorityKeyIdentifier`, if present in the Certificate, is modified in the Precertificate, as described in [RFC 6962, Section 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962#section-3.2).

| __Extension__                                        | __Presence__ | __Critical__ | __Description__ |
| ----                                                 | -            | -            | ----- |
| Precertificate Poison (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.3) | MUST         | Y            | See [Section 7.1.2.9.3](#71293-precertificate-poison) |
| `authorityKeyIdentifier`                             | \*           | \*           | See [Section 7.1.2.9.4](#71294-precertificate-authority-key-identifier) |
| Signed Certificate Timestamp List                    | MUST NOT     | -            | |
| Any other extension                                  | \*           | \*           | The order, criticality, and encoded values of all other extensions MUST be byte-for-byte identical to the `extensions` field of the Certificate |

##### 7.1.2.9.3 Precertificate Poison

The Precertificate MUST contain the Precertificate Poison extension (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.3).

This extension MUST have an `extnValue` `OCTET STRING` which is exactly the hex-encoded bytes `0500`, the encoded representation of the ASN.1 NULL value, as specified in [RFC 6962, Section 3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962#section-3.1).

##### 7.1.2.9.4 Precertificate Authority Key Identifier

For Precertificates issued by a Precertificate Signing CA, the contents of the `authorityKeyIdentifier` extension MUST be one of the following:

1. SHOULD be as defined in the profile below, or;
2. MAY be byte-for-byte identical with the contents of the `authorityKeyIdentifier` extension of the corresponding Certificate.


| __Field__                   | __Description__ |
| ---                         | ------- |
| `keyIdentifier`             | MUST be present. MUST be identical to the `subjectKeyIdentifier` field of the [Precertificate Signing CA Certificate](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile) |
| `authorityCertIssuer`       | MUST NOT be present |
| `authorityCertSerialNumber` | MUST NOT be present |


**Note**: [RFC 6962](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962) describes how the `authorityKeyIdentifier` present on a Precertificate is transformed to contain the value of the Precertificate Signing CA's `authorityKeyIdentifier` extension (i.e. reflecting the actual issuer certificate's `keyIdentifier`), thus matching the corresponding Certificate when verified by clients. These Baseline Requirements RECOMMEND the use of the Precertificate Signing CA's `keyIdentifier` in Precertificates issued by it in order to ensure consistency between the `subjectKeyIdentifier` and `authorityKeyIdentifier` of all certificates in the chain. Although [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280) does not strictly require such consistency, a number of client implementations enforce such consistency for Certificates, and this avoids any risks from Certificate Transparency Logs incorrectly implementing such checks.

#### 7.1.2.10 Common CA Fields

This section contains several fields that are common among multiple CA Certificate profiles. However, these fields may not be common among all CA Certificate profiles. Before issuing a certificate, the CA MUST ensure the certificate contents, including the contents of each field, complies in whole with all of the requirements of at least one Certificate Profile documented in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions).

##### 7.1.2.10.1 CA Certificate Validity

| __Field__   | __Minimum__ | __Maximum__ |
| --          | ----        | ----        |
| `notBefore` | One day prior to the time of signing | The time of signing |
| `notAfter`  | The time of signing | Unspecified |

##### 7.1.2.10.2 CA Certificate Naming

All `subject` names MUST be encoded as specified in [Section 7.1.4](#714-name-forms).

The following table details the acceptable `AttributeType`s that may appear within the `type` field of an `AttributeTypeAndValue`, as well as the contents permitted within the `value` field.

| __Attribute Name__       | __Presence__    | __Value__ | __Verification__ |
| ---                      | -               | ------    | -- |
| `countryName`            | MUST            | The two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code for the country in which the CA's place of business is located. | [Section 3.2.2.3](#3223-verification-of-country) |
| `stateOrProvinceName`    | MAY             | If present, the CA's state or province information. | [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-identity) |
| `localityName`           | MAY             | If present, the CA's locality. | [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-identity) |
| `postalCode`             | MAY             | If present, the CA's zip or postal information. | [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-identity) |
| `streetAddress`          | MAY             | If present, the CA's street address. Multiple instances MAY be present. | [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-identity) |
| `organizationName`       | MUST            | The CA's name or DBA. The CA MAY include information in this field that differs slightly from the verified name, such as common variations or abbreviations, provided that the CA documents the difference and any abbreviations used are locally accepted abbreviations; e.g. if the official record shows "Company Name Incorporated", the CA MAY use "Company Name Inc." or "Company Name". | [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-dbatradename) |
| `organizationalUnitName`  | This attribute MUST NOT be included in Root CA Certificates defined in [Section 7.1.2.1](#7121-root-ca-certificate-profile) or TLS Subordinate CA Certificates defined in [Section 7.1.2.5](#7125-technically-constrained-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile) or Technically-Constrained TLS Subordinate CA Certificates defined in [Section 7.1.2.6](#7126-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile). This attribute SHOULD NOT be included in other types of CA Certificates. | -           | -           |
| `commonName`             | MUST            | The contents SHOULD be an identifier for the certificate such that the certificate's Name is unique across all certificates issued by the issuing certificate. | |
| Any other attribute      | NOT RECOMMENDED | -           | See [Section 7.1.4.4](#7144-other-subject-attributes) |

##### 7.1.2.10.3 CA Certificate Authority Information Access

If present, the `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MUST contain one or more `AccessDescription`s. Each `AccessDescription` MUST only contain a permitted `accessMethod`, as detailed below, and each `accessLocation` MUST be encoded as the specified `GeneralName` type.

The `AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax` MAY contain multiple `AccessDescription`s with the same `accessMethod`, if permitted for that `accessMethod`. When multiple `AccessDescription`s are present with the same `accessMethod`, each `accessLocation` MUST be unique, and each `AccessDescription` MUST be ordered in priority for that `accessMethod`, with the most-preferred `accessLocation` being the first `AccessDescription`. No ordering requirements are given for `AccessDescription`s that contain different `accessMethod`s, provided that previous requirement is satisfied.

| `cA`                | MUST be set TRUE |
| `pathLenConstraint` | MAY be present |

##### 7.1.2.10.5 CA Certificate Certificate Policies

If present, the Certificate Policies extension MUST contain at least one `PolicyInformation`. Each `PolicyInformation` MUST match the following profile:


Table: No Policy Restrictions (Affiliated CA)

| __Field__          | __Presence__    | __Contents__ |
| ---                | -               | ------       |
| `policyIdentifier` | MUST            | When the Issuing CA wishes to express that there are no policy restrictions, the Subordinate CA MUST be an Affiliate of the Issuing CA. The Certificate Policies extension MUST contain only a single `PolicyInformation` value, which MUST contain the `anyPolicy` Policy Identifier. |
|     `anyPolicy`    | MUST            | |
| `policyQualifiers` | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST contain only permitted `policyQualifiers` from the table below. |


Table: Policy Restricted

| __Field__                | __Presence__    | __Contents__ |
| ---                      | -               | ------       |
| `policyIdentifier`       | MUST            | One of the following policy identifiers: |
|     A [Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) | MUST | The CA MUST include at least one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier (see [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers)) associated with the given Subscriber Certificate type (see [Section 7.1.2.7.1](#71271-subscriber-certificate-types)) directly or transitively issued by this Certificate. |
|     `anyPolicy`          | MUST NOT        | The `anyPolicy` Policy Identifier MUST NOT be present. |
|     Any other identifier | MAY             | If present, MUST be defined by the CA and documented by the CA in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. |
| `policyQualifiers`       | NOT RECOMMENDED | If present, MUST contain only permitted `policyQualifiers` from the table below. |


This Profile RECOMMENDS that the first `PolicyInformation` value within the Certificate Policies extension contains the Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier (see [7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers))[^first_policy_note]. Regardless of the order of `PolicyInformation` values, the Certificate Policies extension MUST contain exactly one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier.


**Note**: policyQualifiers is NOT RECOMMENDED to be present in any Certificate issued under this Certificate Profile because this information increases the size of the Certificate without providing any value to a typical Relying Party, and the information may be obtained by other means when necessary.


If the `policyQualifiers` is permitted and present within a `PolicyInformation` field, it MUST be formatted as follows:


Table: Permitted `policyQualifiers`

The following table contains the requirements for the `GeneralName` that appears within the `base` of a `GeneralSubtree` in either the `permittedSubtrees` or `excludedSubtrees`.

Table: `GeneralName` requirements for the `base` field

| __Name Type__   | __Presence__    |  __Permitted Subtrees__ | __Excluded Subtrees__ |
| --              | -               | ----                    | ----                  |
| `dNSName`       | MAY             | The CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has registered the `dNSName` or has been authorized by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf. See [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control). | If at least one `dNSName` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MAY indicate one or more subordinate domains to be excluded. |
| `iPAddress`     | MAY             | The CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has been assigned the `iPAddress` range or has been authorized by the assigner to act on the asignee's behalf. See [Section 3.2.2.5](#3225-authentication-for-an-ip-address). | If at least one `iPAddress` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MAY indicate one or more subdivisions of those ranges to be excluded. |
| `directoryName` | MAY             | The CA MUST confirm the Applicant's and/or Subsidiary's name attributes such that all certificates issued will comply with the relevant Certificate Profile (see [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions)), including Name Forms (See [Section 7.1.4](#714-name-forms)). | It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include values within `excludedSubtrees`. |
| `rfc822Name`    | NOT RECOMMENDED | The CA MAY constrain to a mailbox, a particular host, or any address within a domain, as specified within [RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10). For each host, domain, or Domain portion of a Mailbox (as specified within [RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6)), the CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has registered the domain or has been authorized by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf. See [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control). | If at least one `rfc822Name` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MAY indicate one or more mailboxes, hosts, or domains to be excluded. | If no `rfc822Name` instance is present in the `permittedSubtrees`, then the CA MAY include a zero-length `rfc822Name` to indicate no mailboxes are permitted. |
| `otherName`     | NOT RECOMMENDED | See below                | See below             | See below                      |

Any `otherName`, if present:

  1. MUST apply in the context of the public Internet, unless:
     a. the `type-id` falls within an OID arc for which the Applicant demonstrates ownership, or,
     b. the Applicant can otherwise demonstrate the right to assert the data in a public context.
  2. MUST NOT include semantics that will mislead the Relying Party about certificate information verified by the CA.
  3. MUST be DER encoded according to the relevant ASN.1 module defining the `otherName` `type-id` and `value`.

CAs SHALL NOT include additional names unless the CA is aware of a reason for including the data in the Certificate.

#### 7.1.2.11 Common Certificate Fields

This section contains several fields that are common among multiple certificate profiles. However, these fields may not be common among all certificate profiles. Before issuing a certificate, the CA MUST ensure the certificate contents, including the contents of each field, complies in whole with all of the requirements of at least one Certificate Profile documented in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions).

##### 7.1.2.11.1 Authority Key Identifier

| __Field__                   | __Description__ |
| ---                         | ------- |
| `keyIdentifier`             | MUST be present. MUST be identical to the `subjectKeyIdentifier` field of the Issuing CA. |
| `authorityCertIssuer`       | MUST NOT be present |
| `authorityCertSerialNumber` | MUST NOT be present |

##### 7.1.2.11.2 CRL Distribution Points

The CRL Distribution Points extension MUST be present in:

- Subordinate CA Certificates; and
- Subscriber Certificates that 1) do not qualify as "Short-lived Subscriber Certificates" and 2) do not include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

The CRL Distribution Points extension SHOULD NOT be present in:

- Root CA Certificates.

The CRL Distribution Points extension is OPTIONAL in:

- Short-lived Subscriber Certificates.

The CRL Distribution Points extension MUST NOT be present in:

- OCSP Responder Certificates.

When present, the CRL Distribution Points extension MUST contain at least one `DistributionPoint`; containing more than one is NOT RECOMMENDED. All `DistributionPoint` items must be formatted as follows:

Table: `DistributionPoint` profile

| __Field__           | __Presence__    | __Description__ |
| ---                 | --              | ------          |
| `distributionPoint` | MUST            | The `DistributionPointName` MUST be a `fullName` formatted as described below. |
| `reasons`           | MUST NOT        |                 |
| `cRLIssuer`         | MUST NOT        |                 |

A `fullName` MUST contain at least one `GeneralName`; it MAY contain more than one. All `GeneralName`s MUST be of type `uniformResourceIdentifier`, and the scheme of each MUST be "http". The first `GeneralName` must contain the HTTP URL of the Issuing CA's CRL service for this certificate.

##### 7.1.2.11.3 Signed Certificate Timestamp List

If present, the Signed Certificate Timestamp List extension contents MUST be an `OCTET STRING` containing the encoded `SignedCertificateTimestampList`, as specified in [RFC 6962, Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-3.3).

Each `SignedCertificateTimestamp` included within the `SignedCertificateTimestampList` MUST be for a `PreCert` `LogEntryType` that corresponds to the current certificate.

##### 7.1.2.11.4 Subject Key Identifier

If present, the `subjectKeyIdentifier` MUST be set as defined within [RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.2). The CA MUST generate a `subjectKeyIdentifier` that is unique within the scope of all Certificates it has issued for each unique public key (the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field of the `tbsCertificate`). For example, CAs may generate the subject key identifier using an algorithm derived from the public key, or may generate a sufficiently-large unique number, such as by using a CSPRNG.

##### 7.1.2.11.5 Other Extensions

All extensions and extension values not directly addressed by the applicable certificate profile:

  1. MUST apply in the context of the public Internet, unless:
     a. the extension OID falls within an OID arc for which the Applicant demonstrates ownership, or,
     b. the Applicant can otherwise demonstrate the right to assert the data in a public context.
  2. MUST NOT include semantics that will mislead the Relying Party about certificate information verified by the CA (such as including an extension that indicates a Private Key is stored on a smart card, where the CA is not able to verify that the corresponding Private Key is confined to such hardware due to remote issuance).
  3. MUST be DER encoded according to the relevant ASN.1 module defining the extension and extension values.

CAs SHALL NOT include additional extensions or values unless the CA is aware of a reason for including the data in the Certificate.

### 7.1.3 Algorithm object identifiers

#### 7.1.3.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo

The following requirements apply to the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field within a Certificate or Precertificate. No other encodings are permitted.

##### 7.1.3.1.1 RSA

The CA SHALL indicate an RSA key using the rsaEncryption (OID: 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1) algorithm identifier. The parameters MUST be present, and MUST be an explicit NULL.

When encoded, the `AlgorithmIdentifier` for RSA keys MUST be byte-for-byte identical with the following hex-encoded bytes: `300d06092a864886f70d0101010500`

##### 7.1.3.1.2 ECDSA

The CA SHALL indicate an ECDSA key using the id-ecPublicKey (OID: 1.2.840.10045.2.1) algorithm identifier. The parameters MUST use the `namedCurve` encoding.

* For P-521 keys, `301006072a8648ce3d020106052b81040023`.

#### 7.1.3.2 Signature AlgorithmIdentifier

All objects signed by a CA Private Key MUST conform to these requirements on the use of the `AlgorithmIdentifier` or `AlgorithmIdentifier`-derived type in the context of signatures.

In particular, it applies to all of the following objects and fields:

* The `signatureAlgorithm` field of a Certificate or Precertificate.
* The `signature` field of a TBSCertificate (for example, as used by either a Certificate or Precertificate).
* The `signatureAlgorithm` field of a CertificateList

  ```

In addition, the CA MAY use the following signature algorithm and encoding if all of the following conditions are met:

* If used within a Certificate, such as the `signatureAlgorithm` field of a Certificate or the `signature` field of a TBSCertificate:
  * The new Certificate is a Root CA Certificate or Subordinate CA Certificate that is a Cross-Certificate; and,
  * There is an existing Certificate, issued by the same issuing CA Certificate, using the following encoding for the signature algorithm; and,

  * All unexpired, un-revoked Certificates that contain the Public Key of the CA Key Pair and that have the same Subject Name MUST also contain an `extKeyUsage` extension with the only key usage present being the id-kp-ocspSigning (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) key usage.
* If used within a CRL, such as the `signatureAlgorithm` field of a CertificateList or the `signature` field of a TBSCertList:
  * The CRL is referenced by one or more Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificates; and,
  * The Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate has issued one or more Certificates using the following encoding for the signature algorithm.

**Note**: The above requirements do not permit a CA to sign a Precertificate with this encoding.

* RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-1:

  Encoding:
  `300d06092a864886f70d0101050500`

##### 7.1.3.2.2 ECDSA

### 7.1.4 Name Forms

This section details encoding rules that apply to all Certificates issued by a CA. Further restrictions may be specified within [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions), but these restrictions do not supersede these requirements.

#### 7.1.4.1 Name Encoding

The following requirements apply to all Certificates listed in [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions). Specifically, this includes Technically Constrained Non-TLS Subordinate CA Certificates, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.3](#7123-technically-constrained-non-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), but does not include certificates issued by such CA Certificates, as they are out of scope of these Baseline Requirements.

For every valid Certification Path (as defined by [RFC 5280, Section 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6)):

* For each Certificate in the Certification Path, the encoded content of the Issuer Distinguished Name field of a Certificate SHALL be byte-for-byte identical with the encoded form of the Subject Distinguished Name field of the Issuing CA certificate.
* For each CA Certificate in the Certification Path, the encoded content of the Subject Distinguished Name field of a Certificate SHALL be byte-for-byte identical among all Certificates whose Subject Distinguished Names can be compared as equal according to [RFC 5280, Section 7.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-7.1), and including expired and revoked Certificates.

When encoding a `Name`, the CA SHALL ensure that:

  * Each `Name` MUST contain an `RDNSequence`.
  * Each `RelativeDistinguishedName` MUST contain exactly one `AttributeTypeAndValue`.
  * Each `RelativeDistinguishedName`, if present, is encoded within the `RDNSequence` in the order that it appears in [Section 7.1.4.2](#7142-subject-attribute-encoding).
    * For example, a `RelativeDistinguishedName` that contains a `countryName` `AttributeTypeAndValue` pair MUST be encoded within the `RDNSequence` before a `RelativeDistinguishedName` that contains a `stateOrProvinceName` `AttributeTypeAndValue`.
  * Each `Name` MUST NOT contain more than one instance of a given `AttributeTypeAndValue` across all `RelativeDistinguishedName`s unless explicitly allowed in these Requirements.

**Note**: [Section 7.1.2.2.2](#71222-cross-certified-subordinate-ca-naming) provides an exception to the above `Name` encoding requirements when issuing a [Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate](#7122-cross-certified-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), as described within that section.

#### 7.1.4.2 Subject Attribute Encoding

This document defines requirements for the content and validation of a number of attributes that may appear within the `subject` field of a `tbsCertificate`. CAs SHALL NOT include these attributes unless their content has been validated as specified by, and only if permitted by, the relevant certificate profile specified within [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions).

CAs that include attributes in the Certificate `subject` field that are listed in the table below SHALL encode those attributes in the relative order as they appear in the table and follow the specified encoding requirements for the attribute.

Table: Encoding and Order Requirements for Selected Attributes

[^surname_givenname]: **Note**: Although RFC 5280 specifies the upper bound as 32,768 characters, this was a transcription error from X.520 (08/2005). The effective (interoperable) upper bound is 64 characters.

CAs that include attributes in the Certificate `subject` field that are listed in the table below SHALL follow the specified encoding requirements for the attribute.

[^maxlength]: **Note**: ASN.1 length limits for DirectoryString are expressed as character limits, not byte limits.

#### 7.1.4.3 Subscriber Certificate Common Name Attribute

If present, this attribute MUST contain exactly one entry that is one of the values contained in the Certificate's `subjectAltName` extension (see [Section 7.1.2.7.12](#712712-subscriber-certificate-subject-alternative-name)). The value of the field MUST be encoded as follows:

  * If the value is an IPv4 address, then the value MUST be encoded as an IPv4Address as specified in RFC 3986, Section 3.2.2.
  * If the value is an IPv6 address, then the value MUST be encoded in the text representation specified in RFC 5952, Section 4.
  * If the value is a Fully-Qualified Domain Name or Wildcard Domain Name, then the value MUST be encoded as a character-for-character copy of the `dNSName` entry value from the `subjectAltName` extension. Specifically, all Domain Labels of the Fully-Qualified Domain Name or FQDN portion of the Wildcard Domain Name must be encoded as LDH Labels, and P-Labels MUST NOT be converted to their Unicode representation.

#### 7.1.4.4 Other Subject Attributes

When explicitly stated as permitted by the relevant certificate profile specified within [Section 7.1.2](#712-certificate-content-and-extensions), CAs MAY include additional attributes within the `AttributeTypeAndValue` beyond those specified in [Section 7.1.4.2](#7142-subject-attribute-encoding).

Before including such an attribute, the CA SHALL:

  * Document the attributes within Section 7.1.4 of their CP or CPS, along with the applicable validation practices.
  * Ensure that the contents contain information that has been verified by the CA, independent of the Applicant.

### 7.1.5 Name constraints

### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as an optional means of asserting that a Certificate complies with these Requirements.

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) baseline-requirements(2) domain-validated(1)} (2.23.140.1.2.1)`

### 7.1.7 Usage of Policy Constraints extension

### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

## 7.2 CRL profile

Prior to 2024‐03‐15, the CA SHALL issue CRLs in accordance with the profile specified in these Requirements or the profile specified in Version 1.8.7 of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Certificates. Effective 2024‐03‐15, the CA SHALL issue CRLs in accordance with the profile specified in these Requirements.

If the CA asserts compliance with these Baseline Requirements, all CRLs that it issues MUST comply with the following CRL profile, which incorporates, and is derived from [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). Except as explicitly noted, all normative requirements imposed by RFC 5280 shall apply, in addition to the normative requirements imposed by this document. CAs SHOULD examine [RFC 5280, Appendix B](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#appendix-B) for further issues to be aware of.

A full and complete CRL is a CRL whose scope includes all Certificates issued by the CA.

A partitioned CRL (sometimes referred to as a "sharded CRL") is a CRL with a constrained scope, such as all Certificates issued by the CA during a certain period of time ("temporal sharding"). Aside from the presence of the Issuing Distribution Point extension (OID 2.5.29.28) in partitioned CRLs, both CRL formats are syntactically the same from the perspective of this profile.

Minimally, CAs MUST issue either a "full and complete" CRL or a set of "partitioned" CRLs which cover the complete set of Certificates issued by the CA. In other words, if issuing only partitioned CRLs, the combined scope of those CRLs must be equivalent to that of a full and complete CRL. 

CAs MUST NOT issue indirect CRLs (i.e., the issuer of the CRL is not the issuer of all Certificates that are included in the scope of the CRL).

| `crlEntryExtensions` | *            | See the "crlEntryExtensions Component" table for additional requirements. |

**Note:** The CA SHOULD update the revocation date in a CRL entry when it is determined that the private key of the Certificate was compromised prior to the revocation date that is indicated in the CRL entry for that Certificate. Backdating the revocationDate field is an exception to best practice described in RFC 5280 (Section 5.3.2); however, these requirements specify the use of the revocationDate field to support TLS implementations that process the revocationDate field as the date when the Certificate is first considered to be compromised.

Table: crlEntryExtensions Component

Table: CRLReasons

| __RFC 5280 reasonCode__   | __RFC 5280 reasonCode value__ | __Description__ |

| unspecified               | 0    | Represented by the omission of a reasonCode. MUST be omitted if the CRL entry is for a Certificate not technically capable of causing issuance unless the CRL entry is for a Subscriber Certificate subject to these Requirements revoked prior to July 15, 2023. 
| keyCompromise             | 1    | Indicates that it is known or suspected that the Subscriber’s Private Key has been compromised. |
| affiliationChanged        | 3    | Indicates that the Subject's name or other Subject Identity Information in the Certificate has changed, but there is no cause to suspect that the Certificate's Private Key has been compromised. |
| superseded                | 4    | Indicates that the Certificate is being replaced because: the Subscriber has requested a new Certificate, the CA has reasonable evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any fully‐qualified domain name or IP address in the Certificate should not be relied upon, or the CA has revoked the Certificate for compliance reasons such as the Certificate does not comply with these Baseline Requirements or the CA's CP or CPS. |
| cessationOfOperation      | 5    | Indicates that the website with the Certificate is shut down prior to the expiration of the Certificate, or if the Subscriber no longer owns or controls the Domain Name in the Certificate prior to the expiration of the Certificate.
| certificateHold           | 6    | MUST NOT be included if the CRL entry is for 1) a Certificate subject to these Requirements, or 2) a Certificate not subject to these Requirements and was either A) issued on-or-after 2020-09-30 or B) has a `notBefore` on-or-after 2020-09-30.
| privilegeWithdrawn        | 9    | Indicates that there has been a subscriber-side infraction that has not resulted in keyCompromise, such as the Certificate Subscriber provided misleading information in their Certificate Request or has not upheld their material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use. |

The Subscriber Agreement, or an online resource referenced therein, MUST inform Subscribers about the revocation reason options listed above and provide explanation about when to choose each option. Tools that the CA provides to the Subscriber MUST allow for these options to be easily specified when the Subscriber requests revocation of their Certificate, with the default value being that no revocation reason is provided (i.e. the default corresponds to the CRLReason “unspecified (0)” which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL). 

The privilegeWithdrawn reasonCode SHOULD NOT be made available to the Subscriber as a revocation reason option, because the use of this reasonCode is determined by the CA and not the Subscriber.

When a CA obtains verifiable evidence of Key Compromise for a Certificate whose CRL entry does not contain a reasonCode extension or has a reasonCode extension with a non-keyCompromise reason, the CA SHOULD update the CRL entry to enter keyCompromise as the CRLReason in the reasonCode extension. 

#### 7.2.2.1 CRL Issuing Distribution Point

Partitioned CRLs MUST contain an Issuing Distribution Point extension. The `distributionPoint` field of the Issuing Distribution Point extension MUST be present. Additionally, the `fullName` field of the DistributionPointName value MUST be present, and its value MUST conform to the following requirements:

1. If a Certificate within the scope of the CRL contains a CRL Distribution Points extension, then at least one of the `uniformResourceIdentifiers` in the CRL Distribution Points's `fullName` field MUST be included in the `fullName` field of the CRL's Issuing Distribution Point extension. The encoding of the `uniformResourceIdentifier` value in the Issuing Distribution Point extension SHALL be byte-for-byte identical to the encoding used in the Certificate's CRL Distribution Points extension.
2. Other GeneralNames of type `uniformResourceIdentifier` MAY be included.
3. Non-`uniformResourceIdentifier` GeneralName types MUST NOT be included.

The `indirectCRL` and `onlyContainsAttributeCerts` fields MUST be set to `FALSE` (i.e., not asserted).

The CA MAY set either of the `onlyContainsUserCerts` and `onlyContainsCACerts` fields to `TRUE`, depending on the scope of the CRL. 

The CA MUST NOT assert both of the `onlyContainsUserCerts` and `onlyContainsCACerts` fields. 

The `onlySomeReasons` field SHOULD NOT be included; if included, then the CA MUST provide another CRL whose scope encompasses all revocations regardless of reason code. 

This extension is NOT RECOMMENDED for full and complete CRLs.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

If an OCSP response is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate, including Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificates, and that certificate has been revoked, then the `revocationReason` field within the `RevokedInfo` of the `CertStatus` MUST be present.

The `CRLReason` indicated MUST contain a value permitted for CRLs, as specified in [Section 7.2.2](#722-crl-and-crl-entry-extensions).

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

### 7.3.2 OCSP extensions

The `singleExtensions` of an OCSP response MUST NOT contain the `reasonCode` (OID 2.5.29.21) CRL entry extension.

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Comply with these Requirements;
2. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
3. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Implementers' Note**: Version 1.1.6 of the SSL Baseline Requirements was published on July 29, 2013. Version 2.0 of WebTrust's Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities - SSL Baseline with Network Security and ETSI's Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI) 102 042 incorporate version 1.1.6 of these Baseline Requirements and version 1.0 of the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements. The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. Our coordination with compliance auditors will continue as we develop guideline revision cycles that harmonize with the revision cycles for audit criteria, the compliance auditing periods and cycles of CAs, and the CA/Browser Forum's guideline implementation dates.

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST either be Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.2.3](#7123-technically-constrained-non-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-technically-constrained-precertificate-signing-ca-certificate-profile), or [Section 7.1.2.5](#7125-technically-constrained-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), as well as audited in line with [Section 8.7](#87-self-audits) only, or Unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted Certificate.

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed by WebTrust;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage

## 8.3 Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.1 or newer” AND “WebTrust for CAs SSL Baseline with Network Security v2.3 or newer”; or
2. ETSI EN 319 411-1 v1.2.2, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
3. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.

Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties which are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). However, if the CA or Delegated Third Party is under the operation, control, or supervision of a Government Entity and the audit scheme is completed over multiple years, then the annual audit MUST cover at least the core controls that are required to be audited annually by such scheme plus that portion of all non-core controls that are allowed to be conducted less frequently, but in no case may any non-core control be audited less often than once every three years.

## 8.5 Actions taken as a result of deficiency

## 8.6 Communication of results

The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA MUST make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report MUST contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. name of the organization being audited;
2. name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. the SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the certificates (and associated keys);
5. a list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. the start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. the point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. the date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; and
10. (for audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g. DVCP, OVCP, NCP, NCP+, LCP, EVCP, EVCP+, QCP-w, Part 1 (General Requirements), and/or Part 2 (Requirements for Trust Service Providers).
11. (for audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information MUST be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure it is publicly available.

The Audit Report MUST be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report MUST be uppercase letters and MUST NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds.

## 8.7 Self-Audits

During the period in which the CA issues Certificates, the CA SHALL monitor adherence to its Certificate Policy, Certification Practice Statement and these Requirements and strictly control its service quality by performing self audits on at least a quarterly basis against a randomly selected sample of the greater of one certificate or at least three percent of the Certificates issued by it during the period commencing immediately after the previous self-audit sample was taken. Except for Delegated Third Parties that undergo an annual audit that meets the criteria specified in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), the CA SHALL strictly control the service quality of Certificates issued or containing information verified by a Delegated Third Party by having a Validation Specialist employed by the CA perform ongoing quarterly audits against a randomly selected sample of at least the greater of one certificate or three percent of the Certificates verified by the Delegated Third Party in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken. The CA SHALL review each Delegated Third Party's practices and procedures to ensure that the Delegated Third Party is in compliance with these Requirements and the relevant Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

The CA SHALL internally audit each Delegated Third Party's compliance with these Requirements on an annual basis.

During the period in which a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA issues Certificates, the CA which signed the Subordinate CA SHALL monitor adherence to the CA's Certificate Policy and the Subordinate CA's Certification Practice Statement. On at least a quarterly basis, against a randomly selected sample of the greater of one certificate or at least three percent of the Certificates issued by the Subordinate CA, during the period commencing immediately after the previous audit sample was taken, the CA shall ensure all applicable CP are met.

### 9.6.1 CA representations and warranties

By issuing a Certificate, the CA makes the certificate warranties listed herein to the following Certificate Beneficiaries:

1. The Subscriber that is a party to the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use for the Certificate;
2. All Application Software Suppliers with whom the Root CA has entered into a contract for inclusion of its Root Certificate in software distributed by such Application Software Supplier; and
3. All Relying Parties who reasonably rely on a Valid Certificate.
The CA represents and warrants to the Certificate Beneficiaries that, during the period when the Certificate is valid, the CA has complied with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement in issuing and managing the Certificate.

The Certificate Warranties specifically include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. **Right to Use Domain Name or IP Address**: That, at the time of issuance, the CA
   i. implemented a procedure for verifying that the Applicant either had the right to use, or had control of, the Domain Name(s) and IP address(es) listed in the Certificate's `subject` field and `subjectAltName` extension (or, only in the case of Domain Names, was delegated such right or control by someone who had such right to use or control);
   ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
   iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
2. **Authorization for Certificate**: That, at the time of issuance, the CA
   i. implemented a procedure for verifying that the Subject authorized the issuance of the Certificate and that the Applicant Representative is authorized to request the Certificate on behalf of the Subject;
   ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
   iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
3. **Accuracy of Information**: That, at the time of issuance, the CA

   ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
   iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;
5. **Subscriber Agreement**: That, if the CA and Subscriber are not Affiliated, the Subscriber and CA are parties to a legally valid and enforceable Subscriber Agreement that satisfies these Requirements, or, if the CA and Subscriber are the same entity or are Affiliated, the Applicant Representative acknowledged the Terms of Use;
6. **Status**: That the CA maintains a 24 x 7 publicly-accessible Repository with current information regarding the status (valid or revoked) of all unexpired Certificates; and
7. **Revocation**: That the CA will revoke the Certificate for any of the reasons specified in these Requirements.

The Root CA SHALL be responsible for the performance and warranties of the Subordinate CA, for the Subordinate CA's compliance with these Requirements, and for all liabilities and indemnification obligations of the Subordinate CA under these Requirements, as if the Root CA were the Subordinate CA issuing the Certificates

### 9.6.2 RA representations and warranties

No stipulation.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties

The CA SHALL require, as part of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties in this section for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries, either:

1. The Applicant's agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA, or
2. The Applicant's acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the certificate request. The CA MAY use an electronic or "click-through" Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each certificate request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future certificate requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use MUST contain provisions imposing on the Applicant itself (or made by the Applicant on behalf of its principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service relationship) the following obligations and warranties:

1. **Accuracy of Information**: An obligation and warranty to provide accurate and complete information at all times to the CA, both in the certificate request and as otherwise requested by the CA in connection with the issuance of the Certificate(s) to be supplied by the CA;
2. **Protection of Private Key**: An obligation and warranty by the Applicant to take all reasonable measures to assure control of, keep confidential, and properly protect at all times the Private Key that corresponds to the Public Key to be included in the requested Certificate(s) (and any associated activation data or device, e.g. password or token);
3. **Acceptance of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty that the Subscriber will review and verify the Certificate contents for accuracy;
4. **Use of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty to install the Certificate only on servers that are accessible at the `subjectAltName`(s) listed in the Certificate, and to use the Certificate solely in compliance with all applicable laws and solely in accordance with the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use;
5. **Reporting and Revocation**: An obligation and warranty to:
   a. promptly request revocation of the Certificate, and cease using it and its associated Private Key, if there is any actual or suspected misuse or compromise of the Subscriber’s Private Key associated with the Public Key included in the Certificate, and
   b. promptly request revocation of the Certificate, and cease using it, if any information in the Certificate is or becomes incorrect or inaccurate;

6. **Termination of Use of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty to promptly cease all use of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key included in the Certificate upon revocation of that Certificate for reasons of Key Compromise.
7. **Responsiveness**: An obligation to respond to the CA's instructions concerning Key Compromise or Certificate misuse within a specified time period.
8. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance**: An acknowledgment and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the terms of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use or if revocation is required by the CA's CP, CPS, or these Baseline Requirements.

### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

## 9.8 Limitations of liability

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

### 9.16.1 Entire agreement

### 9.16.2 Assignment

### 9.16.3 Severability

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter 'Law') of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA's CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA MUST also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to <questions@cabforum.org> and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at <https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/> (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section MUST be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA's CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, MUST be made within 90 days.

## 9.17 Other provisions

# APPENDIX A – CAA Contact Tag

These methods allow domain owners to publish contact information in DNS for the purpose of validating domain control.

## A.1. CAA Methods

### A.1.1. CAA contactemail Property

SYNTAX: `contactemail <rfc6532emailaddress>`

The CAA contactemail property takes an email address as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid email address as defined in RFC 6532, Section 3.2, with no additional padding or structure, or it cannot be used.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using an email address.

```DNS Zone
$ORIGIN example.com.
               CAA 0 contactemail "domainowner@example.com"
```

The contactemail property MAY be critical, if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.

### A.1.2. CAA contactphone Property

SYNTAX: `contactphone <rfc3966 Global Number>`

The CAA contactphone property takes a phone number as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid Global Number as defined in RFC 3966, Section 5.1.4, or it cannot be used. Global Numbers MUST have a preceding + and a country code and MAY contain visual separators.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using a phone number.

```DNS Zone
$ORIGIN example.com.
               CAA 0 contactphone "+1 (555) 123-4567"
```

The contactphone property MAY be critical if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.

## A.2. DNS TXT Methods

### A.2.1. DNS TXT Record Email Contact

The DNS TXT record MUST be placed on the "`_validation-contactemail`" subdomain of the domain being validated. The entire RDATA value of this TXT record MUST be a valid email address as defined in RFC 6532, Section 3.2, with no additional padding or structure, or it cannot be used.

### A.2.2. DNS TXT Record Phone Contact

The DNS TXT record MUST be placed on the "`_validation-contactphone`" subdomain of the domain being validated. The entire RDATA value of this TXT record MUST be a valid Global Number as defined in RFC 3966, Section 5.1.4, or it cannot be used.

# APPENDIX B – Issuance of Certificates for Onion Domain Names

This appendix defines permissible verification procedures for including one or more Onion Domain Names in a Certificate.

1. The Domain Name MUST contain at least two Domain Labels, where the rightmost Domain Label is "onion", and the Domain Label immediately preceding the rightmost "onion" Domain Label is a valid Version 3 Onion Address, as defined in Section 6 of the Tor Rendezvous Specification - Version 3 located at <https://spec.torproject.org/rend-spec-v3>.

2. The CA MUST verify the Applicant’s control over the Onion Domain Name using at least one of the methods listed below:

   a. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by using one of the following methods from [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control):

      i. [Section 3.2.2.4.18 - Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2](#322418-agreed-upon-change-to-website-v2)
      ii. [Section 3.2.2.4.19 - Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME](#322419-agreed-upon-change-to-website---acme)
      iii. [Section 3.2.2.4.20 - TLS Using ALPN](#322420-tls-using-alpn)

      When these methods are used to verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service, the CA MUST use Tor protocol to establish a connection to the .onion hidden service. The CA MUST NOT delegate or rely on a third-party to establish the connection, such as by using Tor2Web.

      **Note**: This section does not override or supersede any provisions specified within the respective methods. The CA MUST only use a method if it is still permitted within that section and MUST NOT issue Wildcard Certificates or use it as an Authorization Domain Name, except as specified by that method.

   b. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by having the Applicant provide a Certificate Request signed using the .onion service's private key if the Attributes section of the certificationRequestInfo contains:

      i. A caSigningNonce attribute that contains a Random Value that is generated by the CA; and
      ii. An applicantSigningNonce attribute that contains a single value. The CA MUST recommend to Applicants that the applicantSigningNonce value should contain at least 64 bits of entropy.

      The signing nonce attributes have the following format:

      ```ASN.1
      cabf OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) }

      caSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
         WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
         EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
         SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
         ID                       { cabf-caSigningNonce }
      }

      cabf-caSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 41 }

      applicantSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
         WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
         EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
         SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
         ID                       { cabf-applicantSigningNonce }
      }

      cabf-applicantSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 42 }
      ```

      The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values.

      Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the CA MAY also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

3. When a Certificate includes an Onion Domain Name, the Domain Name shall not be considered an Internal Name provided that the Certificate was issued in compliance with this [Appendix B](#appendix-b--issuance-of-certificates-for-onion-domain-names).
