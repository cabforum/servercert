# Introduction

This version 1.7.4 represents the Extended Validation Guidelines, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum as of Ballot SC35, passed by the Server Certificate Working Group on 9 September 2020, and effective as of 19 October 2020.

The Guidelines describe an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing practices specifying the minimum requirements that must be met in order to issue and maintain Extended Validation Certificates ("EV Certificates") concerning an organization.  Subject Organization information from valid EV Certificates can then be used in a special manner by certain relying-party software applications (e.g., browser software) in order to provide users with a trustworthy confirmation of the identity of the entity that controls the Web site or other services they are accessing.  Although initially intended for use in establishing Web-based data communication conduits via TLS/SSL protocols, extensions are envisioned for S/MIME, time-stamping, VoIP, IM, Web services, etc.

The primary purposes of Extended Validation Certificates are to: 1) identify the legal entity that controls a Web or service site, and 2) enable encrypted communications with that site.  The secondary purposes include significantly enhancing cybersecurity by helping establish the legitimacy of an organization claiming to operate a Web site, and providing a vehicle that can be used to assist in addressing problems related to distributing malware, phishing, identity theft, and diverse forms of online fraud.

**Notice to Readers**

The Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates present criteria established by the CA/Browser Forum for use by certification authorities when issuing, maintaining, and revoking certain digital certificates for use in Internet Web site commerce.  These Guidelines may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.  Questions or suggestions concerning these guidelines may be directed to the CA/Browser Forum at <questions@cabforum.org>.

**The CA/Browser Forum**

The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary open organization of certification authorities and suppliers of Internet browsers and other relying-party software applications.  Membership is listed at <https://cabforum.org/members/>.

**Implementers' Note**: Version 1.3 of these EV Guidelines was published on 20 November 2010 and supplemented through May 2012 when version 1.4 was published.  ETSI TS 102 042 and ETSI TR 101 564 Technical Report: Guidance on ETSI TS 102 042 for Issuing Extended Validation Certificates for Auditors and CSPs reference version 1.3 of these EV Guidelines, and ETSI Draft EN 319 411-1 references version 1.4.  Version 1.4.5 of Webtrust(r) for Certification Authorities – Extended Validation Audit Criteria references version 1.4.5 of these EV Guidelines.  As illustrated in the Document History table above, the CA/Browser Forum continues to improve relevant industry guidelines, including this document, the Baseline Requirements, and the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements.  We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion.  In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty. We will respond to implementation questions directed to questions@cabforum.org.  Our coordination with compliance auditors will continue as we develop guideline revision cycles that harmonize with the revision cycles for audit criteria, the compliance auditing periods and cycles of CAs, and the CA/Browser Forum's guideline implementation dates.

# 1. Scope

These Guidelines for the issuance and management of Extended Validation Certificates describe certain of the minimum requirements that a Certification Authority must meet in order to issue Extended Validation Certificates.   Subject Organization information from Valid EV Certificates may be displayed in a special manner by certain relying-party software applications (e.g., browser software) in order to provide users with a trustworthy confirmation of the identity of the entity that controls the Web site they are accessing. These Guidelines incorporate the Baseline Requirements established by the CA/Browser Forum by reference.  A copy of the Baseline Requirements is available on the CA/Browser Forum's website at <https://www.cabforum.org/>.

These Guidelines address the basic issue of validating Subject identity information in EV Certificates and some related matters.   They do not address all of the related matters, such as certain technical and operational ones. This version of the Guidelines addresses only requirements for EV Certificates intended to be used for SSL/TLS authentication on the Internet and for code signing.  Similar requirements for S/MIME, time-stamping, VoIP, IM, Web services, etc. may be covered in future versions.

These Guidelines do not address the verification of information, or the issuance, use, maintenance, or revocation of EV Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, where its Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier.

# 2. Purpose

## 2.1. Purpose of EV Certificates

EV Certificates are intended for establishing Web-based data communication conduits via the TLS/SSL protocols and for verifying the authenticity of executable code.

### 2.1.1. Primary Purposes

The primary purposes of an EV Certificate are to:

1. **Identify the legal entity that controls a Web site**: Provide a reasonable assurance to the user of an Internet browser that the Web site the user is accessing is controlled by a specific legal entity identified in the EV Certificate by name, address of Place of Business, Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration and Registration Number or other disambiguating information; and

2. **Enable encrypted communications with a Web site**: Facilitate the exchange of encryption keys in order to enable the encrypted communication of information over the Internet between the user of an Internet browser and a Web site.

### 2.1.2. Secondary Purposes

The secondary purposes of an EV Certificate are to help establish the legitimacy of a business claiming to operate a Web site or distribute executable code, and to provide a vehicle that can be used to assist in addressing problems related to phishing, malware, and other forms of online identity fraud.  By providing more reliable third-party verified identity and address information regarding the business, EV Certificates may help to:

1. Make it more difficult to mount phishing and other online identity fraud attacks using Certificates;
2. Assist companies that may be the target of phishing attacks or online identity fraud by providing them with a tool to better identify themselves to users; and
3. Assist law enforcement organizations in their investigations of phishing and other online identity fraud, including where appropriate, contacting, investigating, or taking legal action against the Subject.

### 2.1.3. Excluded Purposes

EV Certificates focus only on the identity of the Subject named in the Certificate, and not on the behavior of the Subject.  As such, an EV Certificate is **not** intended to provide any assurances, or otherwise represent or warrant:

1. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is actively engaged in doing business;
2. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate complies with applicable laws;
3. That the Subject named in the EV Certificate is trustworthy, honest, or reputable in its business dealings; or
4. That it is "safe" to do business with the Subject named in the EV Certificate.

EV Certificate Applicants make the commitments and warranties set forth in Section 9.6.3 of the Baseline Requirements for the benefit of the CA and Certificate Beneficiaries.

# 8. Community and Applicability

## 8.1. Issuance of EV Certificates

The CA MAY issue EV Certificates, provided that the CA and its Root CA satisfy the requirements in these Guidelines and the Baseline Requirements.

If a court or government body with jurisdiction over the activities covered by these Guidelines determines that the performance of any mandatory requirement is illegal, then such requirement is considered reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal.  This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.  The parties involved SHALL notify the CA / Browser Forum of the facts, circumstances, and law(s) involved, so that the CA/Browser Forum may revise these Guidelines accordingly.

## 8.2. EV Policies

### 8.2.1. Implementation

Each CA must develop, implement, enforce, display prominently on its Web site, and periodically update as necessary its own auditable EV Certificate practices, policies and procedures, such as a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) and Certificate Policy (CP) that:

A.  Implement the requirements of these Guidelines as they are revised from time-to-time;

B.  Implement the requirements of

    i. the then-current WebTrust Program for CAs, and
    ii. the then-current WebTrust EV Program or ETSI TS 102 042 for EVCP or ETSI EN 319 411-1 for EVCP policy; and

C.  Specify the CA's and its Root CA's entire root certificate hierarchy including all roots that its EV Certificates depend on for proof of those EV Certificates' authenticity.

### 8.2.2. Disclosure

Each CA MUST publicly disclose its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CA business practices to the extent required by the CA's selected audit scheme (see [Section 17.1](#171-eligible-audit-schemes)).

The CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement MUST be structured in accordance with RFC 3647. The Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement MUST include all material required by RFC 3647.

## 8.3. Commitment to Comply with Recommendations

Each CA SHALL publicly give effect to these Guidelines and represent that they will adhere to the latest published version by incorporating them into their respective EV Policies, using a clause such as the following (which must include a link to the official version of these Guidelines):

# 10. EV Certificate Request Requirements

## 10.1. General Requirements

### 10.1.1. Documentation Requirements

The documentation requirements in Section 4.1.2 of the Baseline Requirements apply equally to EV Certificates.

### 10.1.2. Role Requirements

The following Applicant roles are required for the issuance of an EV Certificate.

1. **Certificate Requester**: The EV Certificate Request MUST be submitted by an authorized Certificate Requester.  A Certificate Requester is a natural person who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant, or a third party (such as an ISP or hosting company) that completes and submits an EV Certificate Request on behalf of the Applicant.

2. **Certificate Approver**: The EV Certificate Request MUST be approved by an authorized Certificate Approver.  A Certificate Approver is a natural person who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant to

   i. act as a Certificate Requester and to authorize other employees or third parties to act as a Certificate Requester, and
   ii. to approve EV Certificate Requests submitted by other Certificate Requesters.

3. **Contract Signer**: A Subscriber Agreement applicable to the requested EV Certificate MUST be signed by an authorized Contract Signer.  A Contract Signer is a natural person who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant, and who has authority on behalf of the Applicant to sign Subscriber Agreements.

4. **Applicant Representative**: In the case where the CA and the Subscriber are affiliated, Terms of Use applicable to the requested EV Certificate MUST be acknowledged and agreed to by an authorized Applicant Representative.  An Applicant Representative is a natural person who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant, and who has authority on behalf of the Applicant to acknowledge and agree to the Terms of Use.

The Applicant MAY authorize one individual to occupy two or more of these roles. The Applicant MAY authorize more than one individual to occupy any of these roles.

## 10.2. EV Certificate Request Requirements

The Certificate Request requirements in Section 4.1.2 of the Baseline Requirements apply equally to EV Certificates subject to the additional more stringent ageing and updating requirement of [Section 11.14](#1114-requirements-for-re-use-of-existing-documentation).

Section 9.6.3 of the Baseline Requirements applies equally to EV Certificates.  In cases where the Certificate Request does not contain all necessary information about the Applicant, the CA MUST additionally confirm the data with the Certificate Approver or Contract Signer rather than the Certificate Requester.

# 11. Verification Requirements

## 11.1. General Overview

This part of the Guidelines sets forth Verification Requirements and Acceptable Methods of Verification for each such Requirement.

### 11.1.1. Verification Requirements – Overview

Before issuing an EV Certificate, the CA MUST ensure that all Subject organization information to be included in the EV Certificate conforms to the requirements of, and is verified in accordance with, these Guidelines and matches the information confirmed and documented by the CA pursuant to its verification processes.  Such verification processes are intended to accomplish the following:

1. Verify Applicant's existence and identity, including;

   A.  Verify the Applicant's legal existence and identity (as more fully set forth in [Section 11.2](#112-verification-of-applicants-legal-existence-and-identity)),

   B.  Verify the Applicant's physical existence (business presence at a physical address), and

   C.  Verify the Applicant's operational existence (business activity).

2. Verify the Applicant is a registered holder, or has control, of the Domain Name(s) to be included in the EV Certificate;

3. Verify a reliable means of communication with the entity to be named as the Subject in the Certificate;

4. Verify the Applicant's authorization for the EV Certificate, including;

   A.  Verify the name, title, and authority of the Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, and Certificate Requester,

   B.  Verify that a Contract Signer signed the Subscriber Agreement or that a duly authorized Applicant Representative acknowledged and agreed to the Terms of Use; and

   C.  Verify that a Certificate Approver has signed or otherwise approved the EV Certificate Request.

### 11.1.2. Acceptable Methods of Verification – Overview

As a general rule, the CA is responsible for taking all verification steps reasonably necessary to satisfy each of the Verification Requirements set forth in the subsections below.  The Acceptable Methods of Verification set forth in each of Sections 11.2 through 11.14 (which usually include alternatives) are considered to be the minimum acceptable level of verification required of the CA.  In all cases, however, the CA is responsible for taking any additional verification steps that may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the applicable Verification Requirement.

### 11.1.3. Disclosure of Verification Sources

Effective as of 1 October 2020, prior to the use of an Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency to fulfill these verification requirements, the CA MUST publicly disclose Agency Information about the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency. This disclosure SHALL be through an appropriate and readily accessible online means.

This Agency Information SHALL include at least the following:

* Sufficient information to unambiguously identify the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency (such as a name, jurisdiction, and website); and,
* The accepted value or values for each of the `subject:jurisdictionLocalityName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.1), `subject:jurisdictionStateOrProvinceName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.2), and `subject:jurisdictionCountryName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3) fields, when a certificate is issued using information from that Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency, indicating the jurisdiction(s) that the Agency is appropriate for; and,

3. The CA MUST refrain from issuing an EV Certificate until the entire corpus of information and documentation assembled in support of the EV Certificate Request is such that issuance of the EV Certificate will not communicate factual information that the CA knows, or the exercise of due diligence should discover from the assembled information and documentation, to be inaccurate,.  If satisfactory explanation and/or additional documentation are not received within a reasonable time, the CA MUST decline the EV Certificate Request and SHOULD notify the Applicant accordingly.
4. In the case where some or all of the documentation used to support the application is in a language other than the CA's normal operating language, the CA or its Affiliate MUST perform the requirements of this Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence section using employees under its control and having appropriate training, experience, and judgment in confirming organizational identification and authorization and fulfilling all qualification requirements contained in [Section 14.1](#141-trustworthiness-and-competence).  When employees under the control of the CA do not possess the language skills necessary to perform the Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence a CA MAY:

   A.  Rely on language translations of the relevant portions of the documentation, provided that the translations are received from a Translator; or
   B.  When the CA has utilized the services of an RA, the CA MAY rely on the language skills of the RA to perform the Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence, provided that the RA complies with [Section 11.13](#1113-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence), Subsections (1), (2) and (3).

   i. a point-in-time readiness assessment audit against the WebTrust for CA Program, or
   ii. a point-in-time readiness assessment audit against the WebTrust EV Program, the ETSI TS 102 042 EVCP, or the ETSI EN 319 411-1 for EVCP policy.

The CA MUST complete any required point-in-time readiness assessment no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing an EV Certificate.  The CA MUST undergo a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first EV Certificate.

## 17.5. Regular Self Audits

During the period in which it issues EV Certificates, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self audits against a randomly selected sample of at least three percent of the EV Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken.  For all EV Certificates where the Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence requirements of [Section 11.13](#1113-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence) is performed by an RA, the CA MUST strictly control its service quality by performing ongoing self audits against a randomly selected sample of at least six percent of the EV Certificates it has issued in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken.

## 17.6. Auditor Qualification

A Qualified Auditor (as defined in Section 8.2 of the Baseline Requirements) MUST perform the CA's audit.

## 17.7. Root CA Key Pair Generation

All requirements in Section 6.1.1.1 of the Baseline Requirements apply equally to EV Certificates. However, for Root CA Key Pairs generated after the release of these Guidelines, the Root CA Key Pair generation ceremony MUST be witnessed by the CA's Qualified Auditor in order to observe the process and the controls over the integrity and confidentiality of the Root CA Key Pairs produced.  The Qualified Auditor MUST then issue a report opining that the CA, during its Root CA Key Pair and Certificate generation process:

  1. Documented its Root CA key generation and protection procedures in its Certificate Policy, and its Certification Practices Statement;
  2. Included appropriate detail in its Root Key Generation Script;
  3. Maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Root CA key pair was generated and protected in conformity with the procedures described in its CP/CPS and with its Root Key Generation Script;
  4. Performed, during the Root CA key generation process, all the procedures required by its Root Key Generation Script.

# 18. Liability and Indemnification

CAs MAY limit their liability as described in Section 9.8 of the Baseline Requirements except that a CA MAY NOT limit its liability to Subscribers or Relying Parties for legally recognized and provable claims to a monetary amount less than two thousand US dollars per Subscriber or Relying Party per EV Certificate.

A CA's indemnification obligations and a Root CA's obligations with respect to subordinate CAs are set forth in Section 9.9 of the Baseline Requirements.

# Appendix A - User Agent Verification (Normative)

The CA MUST host test Web pages that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with EV Certificates that chain up to each EV Root Certificate.  At a minimum, the CA MUST host separate Web pages using certificates that are:

  i. valid;
  ii. revoked; and
  iii. expired.

# Appendix D - Country-Specific Interpretative Guidelines (Normative)

NOTE: This appendix provides alternative interpretations of the EV Guidelines for countries that have a language, cultural, technical, or legal reason for deviating from a strict interpretation of the EV Guidelines.  More specific information for particular countries may be added to this appendix in the future.

## 1. Organization Names

1. Non-Latin Organization Name

   Where an EV Applicant's organization name is not registered with a QGIS in _Latin_ characters and the Applicant's foreign character organization name and registration have been verified with a QGIS in accordance with these Guidelines, a CA MAY include a Latin character organization name in the EV Certificate.  In such a case, the CA MUST follow the procedures laid down in this section.

2. Romanized Names

   In order to include a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name, the Romanization MUST be verified by the CA using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation.

   If the CA can not rely on a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, then it MUST rely on one of the options below, in order of preference:

   A.  A system recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO);
   B.  A system recognized by the United Nations; or
   C.  A Lawyer's Opinion or Accountant's Letter confirming the proper Romanization of the registered name.

3. Translated Name

   In order to include a Latin character name in the EV certificate that is not a direct Romanization of the registered name (e.g. an English Name)  the CA MUST verify that the Latin character name is:

   A.  Included in the Articles of Incorporation (or equivalent document) filed as part of the organization registration; or
   B.  Recognized by a QTIS in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation as the Applicant's recognized name for tax filings; or
   C.  Confirmed with a QIIS to be the name associated with the registered organization; or
   D.  Confirmed by a Verified Legal Opinion or Accountant's Letter to be a translated trading name associated with the registered organization.

### Country-Specific Procedures

#### D-1. Japan

As interpretation of the procedures set out above:

1. Organization Names

   A.  The Revised Hepburn method of Romanization, as well as Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki methods described in ISO 3602, are acceptable for Japanese Romanizations.
   B.  The CA MAY verify the Romanized transliteration, language translation (e.g. English name), or other recognized Roman-letter substitute of the Applicant's formal legal name with either a QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter.
   C.  The CA MAY use the Financial Services Agency to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name.  When used, the CA MUST verify that the translated English is recorded in the audited Financial Statements.
   D.  When relying on Articles of Incorporation to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name, the Articles of Incorporation MUST be accompanied either: by a document, signed with the original Japanese Corporate Stamp, that proves that the Articles of Incorporation are authentic and current, or by a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant Letter.  The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Corporate Stamp.
   E.  A Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-lettered substitute name confirmed in accordance with this [Appendix D-1](#d-1-japan) stored in the ROBINS database operated by JIPDEC MAY be relied upon by a CA for determining the allowed organization name during any issuance or renewal process of an EV Certificate without the need to re-perform the above procedures.

2. Accounting Practitioner

   In Japan:

   A.  Accounting Practitioner includes either a certified public accountant (公認会計士 - Konin-kaikei-shi) or a licensed tax accountant (税理士 – Zei-ri-shi).
   B.  The CA MUST verify the professional status of the Accounting Practitioner through direct contact with the relevant local member association that is affiliated with either the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([http://www.hp.jicpa.or.jp](http://www.hp.jicpa.or.jp/)), the Japan Federation of Certified Tax Accountant's Associations ([http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp](http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp/)), or any other authoritative source recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Finance ([http://www.mof.go.jp](http://www.mof.go.jp/)) as providing the current registration status of such professionals.

3. Legal Practitioner

   In Japan:

   A.  Legal Practitioner includes any of the following:

       - a licensed lawyer (弁護士 - Ben-go-shi),
       - a judicial scrivener (司法書士 - Shiho-sho-shi lawyer),
       - an administrative solicitor (行政書士 - Gyosei-sho-shi Lawyer),
       - or a notary public (公証人 - Ko-sho-nin).

       For purposes of the EV Guidelines, a Japanese Notary Public is considered equivalent to a Latin Notary.

   B.  The CA MUST verify the professional status of the Legal Practitioner by direct contact through the relevant local member association that is affiliated with one of the following national associations:

       - the Japan Federation of Bar Associations ([http://www.nichibenren.or.jp](http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/)),
       - the Japan Federation of Shiho-Shoshi Lawyer's Associations ([http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp](http://www.shiho-shoshi.or.jp/)),

       - the Japan National Notaries Association ([http://www.koshonin.gr.jp](http://www.koshonin.gr.jp/)), or
       - any other authoritative source recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Justice ([http://www.moj.go.jp](http://www.moj.go.jp/)) as providing the current registration status of such professionals.

# Appendix E - Sample Contract Signer's Representation/Warranty (Informative)

A CA may rely on the Contract Signer's authority to enter into the Subscriber Agreement using a representation/warranty executed by the Contract Signer.  An example of an acceptable warranty is as follows:

[CA] and Applicant are entering into a legally valid and enforceable Subscriber Agreement that creates extensive obligations on Applicant.  An EV Certificate serves as a form of digital identity for Applicant.  The loss or misuse of this identity can result in great harm to the Applicant.  By signing this Subscriber Agreement, the contract signer acknowledges that they have the authority to obtain the digital equivalent of a company stamp, seal, or (where applicable) officer's signature to establish the authenticity of the company's website, and that [Applicant name] is responsible for all uses of its EV Certificate.  By signing this Agreement on behalf of [Applicant name], the contract signer represents that the contract signer

   i. is acting as an authorized representative of [Applicant name],
   ii. is expressly authorized by [Applicant name] to sign Subscriber Agreements and approve EV Certificate requests on Applicant's behalf, and
   iii. has confirmed Applicant's right to use the domain(s) to be included in EV Certificates.

# Appendix F – Issuance of Certificates for .onion Domain Names

A CA may issue an EV Certificate with .onion in the right-most label of the Domain Name provided that issuance complies with the requirements set forth in this Appendix or Appendix C of the Baseline Requirements.

1. CAB Forum Tor Service Descriptor Hash extension (2.23.140.1.31)

   The CA MUST include the CAB Forum Tor Service Descriptor Hash extension in the `TBSCertificate` to convey hashes of keys related to .onion addresses. The CA MUST include the Tor Service Descriptor Hash extension using the following format:

   ```ASN.1
   cabf-TorServiceDescriptor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 2.23.140.1.31 }

   TorServiceDescriptorSyntax ::=
       SEQUENCE (1..MAX) of TorServiceDescriptorHash

   TorServiceDescriptorHash:: = SEQUENCE {
       onionURI             UTF8String,
       algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,
       subjectPublicKeyHash BIT STRING
   }
   ```

   Where the `AlgorithmIdentifier` is a hashing algorithm (defined in RFC 6234) performed over the DER-encoding of an ASN.1 `subjectPublicKey` of the .onion service and `subjectPublicKeyHash` is the hash output.

2. The CA MUST verify the Applicant's control over the .onion Domain Name using one of the following:

   a. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by posting a specific value at a well-known URL under RFC5785.

   b. The CA MAY verify the Applicant's control over the .onion service by having the Applicant provide a Certificate Request signed using the .onion public key if the `Attributes` section of the `certificationRequestInfo` contains:

      i. A `caSigningNonce` attribute that:

         1. contains a single value with at least 64-bits of entropy,
         2. is generated by the CA, and
         3. delivered to the Applicant through a Verified Method of Communication and

      ii. An `applicantSigningNonce` attribute that:

          1. contains a single value with at least 64-bits of entropy and 
          2. is generated by the Applicant.

      The signing nonce attributes have the following format:

      ```ASN.1
      caSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
          WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
          SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
          ID                       { cabf-caSigningNonce }
      }

      cabf-caSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 41 }

      applicantSigningNonce ATTRIBUTE ::= {
          WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
          EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
          SINGLE VALUE             TRUE
          ID                       { cabf-applicantSigningNonce }
      }

      cabf-applicantSigningNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { cabf 42 }
      ```

3. Each Certificate that includes a Domain Name where .onion is in the right-most label of the Domain Name MUST conform to the requirements of these Guidelines, including the content requirements in Section 7.1 of the Baseline Requirements, except that the CA MAY include a wildcard character in the Subject Alternative Name Extension and Subject Common Name Field as the left-most character in the .onion Domain Name provided inclusion of the wildcard character complies with Section 3.2.2.6 of the Baseline Requirements.

4. CAs MUST NOT issue a Certificate that includes a Domain Name where .onion is in the right-most label of the Domain Name with a Validity Period longer than 15 months. Effective 2020-09-01, CAs MUST NOT issue a Certificate that includes a Domain Name where .onion is in the right-most label of the Domain Name with a Validity Period longer than 398 days.

5. When a Certificate that includes a Domain Name where .onion is in the right-most label of the Domain Name, the Domain Name shall not be considered an Internal Name if the Certificate was issued in compliance with this [Appendix F](#appendix-f--issuance-of-certificates-for-onion-domain-names).

6. On or before May 1, 2015, each CA MUST revoke all Certificates issued with the Subject Alternative Name extension or Common Name field that includes a Domain Name where .onion is in the right-most label of the Domain Name unless the Certificate was issued in compliance with this [Appendix F](#appendix-f--issuance-of-certificates-for-onion-domain-names).
